1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,350
All right, so we're going to get started on our JavaScript here, and I'm not going to say that this

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:10,200
is like an advance project, but a lot of the JavaScript we're going to do here is more in depth than

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,670
some of, you know, the majority of the projects that are in this course.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:21,630
So I'm going to start off by creating a few functions to generate an uppercase letter, a lowercase

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,020
letter, a number and a symbol, because we need to do that.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,630
We need to randomly generate these things to create our password and we need to combine them.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,560
So what I'm going to do is create some functions.

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,570
So this function is going to be called get random lower.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,690
And it's exactly what it's going to do is return a random lowercase letter.

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,160
Now, there's a few ways we can do this.

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,630
What I'm going to do is use the string object.

12
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:56,520
And on that there's a method called from Char Code.

13
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,910
Now, I'm just going to bring this window over for a second here.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,130
So this is the the string object, which is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.

15
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,350
And, you know, there's there's you can you can convert something to a string, but there's a whole

16
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,610
bunch of methods that you can use on this, including from char code.

17
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:26,160
So the static from char code method returns a string created from the specified sequence of UTF 16 code

18
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,790
units.

19
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,990
So basically we can put a number in here which pertains to and this is just the W3 Schools website,

20
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,770
but you can find these and you know, many different places.

21
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:42,510
These are the ASCII printable characters and we have our characters over here.

22
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:51,030
So letters, numbers, symbols, and then they have a specific number or a specific code that pertains

23
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,460
to them.

24
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,530
So if we look at like the numbers here, zero, the code for that is 48 and then it just keeps going.

25
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,240
And the nine is 57.

26
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:10,890
If we want uppercase letters, starts to 65 and ends at 90, lowercase letters start at 97 and end at

27
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,330
122.

28
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:21,720
So using this from character code, if I put a 97 in here and then we'll just do a console log of get

29
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:32,430
random lower and if I go over here, we should get a lowercase A because 97 is the code for lowercase

30
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,940
A, the next letter B would be the code 98.

31
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:38,640
So that gives me B 122.

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,570
Should be A Z.

33
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,490
All right.

34
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:44,820
So what we want to do is just generate a random lowercase.

35
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:55,710
So we'll take the 97, which we know is a right lowercase A and two that I want to just multiply any

36
00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:03,260
number up to 26 because there's 26 characters in, you know, 26 letters in the alphabet.

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:10,170
So what we can do is, first of all, first of all, just take math dot floor, which is going to round

38
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,990
down and then math.

39
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,630
So math dot random.

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,560
And then I just want to multiply that by the highest random number I want to get, which is 26.

41
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,730
And then I'm going to add to that 97.

42
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,000
So this could be, you know, one plus ninety seven, which would be 98, which would be a B or two

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,680
plus ninety seven, which would be C.

44
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,990
So let's just go ahead and save this.

45
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:44,400
And you can see right away we get a V if I reload W, X, L, Z, so it's just going to be a random,

46
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,730
you know, random lowercase number.

47
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,500
So there's other ways you can do this.

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,390
But this is just the way I'm going to do the lowercase, the uppercase and the numbers.

49
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,200
So let's just copy this now and paste that.

50
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,560
And this one is going to be get random upper and we're going to do pretty much the same thing here,

51
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,380
except we want to change the range we still want.

52
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,970
Twenty six is our random number to to add on because we're still dealing with the alphabet.

53
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:24,480
But we want to change this from 97 to 65 because in that chart I showed you uppercase A. was 65.

54
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:32,490
OK, so it's going to just be something twenty six, you know, between one and twenty six plus 65.

55
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:38,700
So if I go ahead and console law, get random upper we get uppercase B, we get O.

56
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,970
S G so it's going to be a random upper case.

57
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:44,070
Let's do the same for numbers.

58
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:55,410
So this will be get random number and instead of twenty six we want ten because it's going to be you

59
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,650
know, up to what's going to be zero through nine.

60
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,670
And then we want.

61
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:06,880
Add on to that 48, because zero has the character, the coat of 48.

62
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:19,440
So if I go down here and I say, get random number, we get three to five, a five eight one.

63
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:20,370
All right.

64
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:25,890
And then four symbols, symbols.

65
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,480
And I'm just going to I just want to use a certain set of symbols.

66
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:37,860
So let's just we'll just as a function, get random symbol.

67
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,160
And I'm just going to grab this string of symbols here.

68
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,090
So I'm going to say const symbols and set that to a string with these specific symbols in it.

69
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,910
And then we want to get a random one of these so return symbols.

70
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,190
And even though this is a string, we can still use an index.

71
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:10,470
Like if I get zero symbols, zero, and we go down here, we say, get random symbol, I'm going to

72
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:13,200
get the the exclamation.

73
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,600
If I do one, I should get the at sign.

74
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,320
So it's zero one, two, three and so on.

75
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:24,870
So I'm just going to get a random number and here that with a max of the length of the entire string.

76
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:36,210
So to do that will do math, dot for math, dot random and let's go ahead and multiply that math dot

77
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:43,000
random by whatever the length of symbols is the length of that string.

78
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,790
So now I see I get a percent if I reload slash.

79
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,890
So I'm just going to get one of these symbols here.

80
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:00,120
So now we have these four functions and we can implement them into, you know, the rest of the application.

81
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,830
Now, one thing I do want to do before we end this specific video is up here.

82
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:14,460
I'm going to create a variable called random func because I want it I want to be able to get a random

83
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,300
lowercase, uppercase number, symbol, whatever.

84
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:23,490
So I'm going to use this object here and give each function a key.

85
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:41,760
So lower is going to be get get random lower and upper, Olby get random upper and no get random number

86
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,040
and symbol will be get a random symbol.

87
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:48,960
All right.

88
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:54,570
So we have this object that has these keys that equal whatever these functions return.

89
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,840
And you'll see why in a little bit when we use these.

90
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,780
But I think we should stop the video here and in the next one will start to work with the DOM and,

91
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,570
you know, start to add some event.

92
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:12,910
Listeners want to be able to click this button, generate a password based on these functions over here.

93
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:17,580
We also want to be able to have the function to copy it to the clipboard.

94
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,820
So we'll get to that stuff in the next video.
