1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,360
All right, so we're going to get started here, I have my project starter open.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,360
I also have a link here to the font awesome CDN so that we can use some icons for the open and close

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:09,930
buttons.

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:19,380
So in the title here, I'm just going to say rotating navigation and down here, let's get rid of this.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,320
Each one, we're going to have a container that wraps everything.

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,910
And in here we're going to have a circle dash container that's going to wrap the circle of the class

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,450
of circle.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,660
And this is basically the, you know, the circle.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,470
It's going to be up in the corner with the buttons.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,950
So in here, we're going to have a button with the idea of close.

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,680
And I just want to use an icon from font.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,160
Awesome.

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:49,050
So eFax and then a dash times will be the icon and right under that will have a button with the idea

14
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:49,740
of open.

15
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,990
And this is going to be the icon eFax and then a dash barres to give us like that, you know, at Hamberger.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:58,320
Look.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:03,480
So if I save that, we're just going to see our two buttons here and now we want to be still within

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,240
the main container, but outside of the circle container.

19
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:11,640
So right above the last div, we're going to have our content and you could put absolutely anything

20
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,350
here in this content, Dev, we're just going to put in each one say amazing article and small tags

21
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,460
will put the author, our good friend, Foreign Pop and then paragraph, let's do Lorem 100 just to

22
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:34,860
throw some dummy text in there under the paragraph, we'll have another H3 and we'll say my dog and

23
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,150
we're going have a picture of a dog.

24
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,740
I'm just going to piece this this image tag in here.

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,530
And of course, like I said, you can put anything you want here.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,110
This is just an on splash image of a dog.

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,110
And then underneath that will have a paragraph will do Lorem 75.

28
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:03,030
And save and get a cute little dog on the screen, so underneath the container, so the container ends

29
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,750
here, the last div, we're going to put our nav, so let's just create a H2O five nav tag with the

30
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,790
URL and then an ally.

31
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,620
And I'm going to use icons here as well.

32
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:25,590
So we'll do I f a s and F a dash home and then next to that icon will just stay home and copy that down

33
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,460
twice.

34
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:31,980
So this one is going to be about I mean, these are probably B links, but that's fine.

35
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,230
You can add the links if you want.

36
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:42,000
So fails, let's do user dash Alz and then for this is going to be contact, these aren't going to be

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,230
actual pages.

38
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:51,030
The point of this project is the the actual animation and the position of the nav and all that, not

39
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,660
the actual inner pages.

40
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,530
So this will use the envelope.

41
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,500
OK, so that should do it for the HTML.

42
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,580
Let's jump into our stylesheet and we'll do a good part of this.

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,050
Now we probably have to break it into another video because there's quite a bit of success, but I'm

44
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,850
going to use the latest font.

45
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,540
So success Questionmark Family equals Lato and then we'll add that to our body.

46
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,470
All right.

47
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,000
And then let's see.

48
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,000
We're actually not going to use all this Fleck's stuff here.

49
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,330
So I'm going to get rid of pretty much all of this except for.

50
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:42,100
Except for the overflow hidden, which I'm actually going to change to overflow accident, so what that

51
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,010
does is it only hides the scroll bar on the x axis.

52
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,220
So going this way.

53
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:51,880
So we want to be able to scroll this way and then margined zero.

54
00:03:51,880 --> 00:04:01,030
And then let's also add a background color of three three three, which is a dark gray.

55
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,740
And then let's have color.

56
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,880
Ta ta two, and I know that that doesn't look right, but we're going to set the container background

57
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,230
color to a light color.

58
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:20,390
So let's do background color and we'll do a three times now with this container.

59
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:27,610
Basically, it's going to rotate a little bit over when it has a specific class of Chenab.

60
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:34,180
So before I add anything else to the container, let's do container when it has shown NAV and we can

61
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:42,730
rotate it with the transformed property and then rotate and I'm going to rotate it negative 20 degrees.

62
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:44,710
All right.

63
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:54,850
And then let's see if we go back here and we just add that class manually to this show NAV, then you

64
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,350
can see it rotates.

65
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,930
And I'm just going to keep that there for a second.

66
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,340
We're going to want to change the transform origin.

67
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,490
So transform origin when you when you rotate the origin by default is going to be like in the middle.

68
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,900
It just it just turns it.

69
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,740
It rotates it.

70
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,510
However, we want it to rotate from the top left position.

71
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,690
So it rotates.

72
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,640
I can't really explain.

73
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:26,710
If you go to the Amdocs for Fortran transform origin, you'll be able to see how it works with different

74
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:27,250
values.

75
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,340
But we want to set the transform origin property to the top left.

76
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:38,730
OK, so now you can see the rotation point is up here instead of in the middle.

77
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:45,850
Now we do want to transition on that because we don't want to just flick, you know, rotate real quick.

78
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,200
We want it to be smooth.

79
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,710
So let's add a transition onto that.

80
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,140
And we want to transition the transform property, say zero point five seconds and we'll just use linear.

81
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,430
So it's just, you know, all one speed or whatever.

82
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,520
And you can see it actually does it when I save because we have that class on it.

83
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,640
Now, I'm going to just go ahead and get rid of that class for now.

84
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,710
But we know that it does rotate when it has that specific class added.

85
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,750
So some other things I want to do here is just set the width to 100 viewport widths.

86
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:26,440
So basically take up the whole, you know, the whole viewport horizontally.

87
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:33,670
And then let's set the min height to I'm going to set that to one hundred viewport heights.

88
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:42,100
So we want to take up the whole viewport and then for padding, let's say padding fifty pixels all the

89
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,540
way around and that should do it for the container.

90
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:55,330
Now let's work on the circle container which is around this so circle Dasch container.

91
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:05,290
And I want to position this in a fixed position and we want it to be like a half circle on the edge

92
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,070
of the page.

93
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:13,090
So we'll set this to negative one hundred pixels for the top and then left same thing, negative 100

94
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:13,720
pixels.

95
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:17,220
And right now we just don't see anything.

96
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,500
Basically the buttons are not showing right now.

97
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:26,980
So far the circle itself, because remember, we have a circle container, but then we also have a class

98
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,020
of circle that wraps around the icon.

99
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:34,000
So this is where we're going to have like the background color, which is going to be hexadecimal F

100
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,520
F seven nine seven nine.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:45,070
And let's set a height of two hundred pixels in a with of two hundred pixels and now you can see it

102
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,180
up in the corner there.

103
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,360
We want this to be a circle.

104
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,450
So Border Dasch radius, we're going to set that to fifty percent, make that a half circle.

105
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,990
I mean it's a full circle but half of it's off the screen.

106
00:07:59,290 --> 00:07:59,890
That's what we did.

107
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:03,490
Negative 100 because we have two hundred for the height and the width.

108
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,570
If you increase or decrease this, you want to adjust that as well.

109
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,250
And we want to position this relative so we can position the buttons inside absolute.

110
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,380
And this is going to rotate.

111
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,780
So I want to add a transition on the transform.

112
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:28,280
Property and let's make that same thing, zero point five seconds linear, it's the same as the container

113
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,060
rotation.

114
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:30,610
All right.

115
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,050
And then for the buttons, let's say a circle button.

116
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,960
And for these, I want to I know we can't see them at the moment, let's actually position them for

117
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:51,630
our sole position, them absolute sort of a position, absolute, and let's put them top 50 percent.

118
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,070
And from the left, 50 percent.

119
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,820
And then let's make the height one hundred pixels.

120
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:13,140
And then let's set and I know it doesn't look right yet, let's set the background to transparent.

121
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,530
And they're both right and they're both from the same exact spot right now, we want to take off that

122
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,070
border.

123
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,170
So Border zero, let's set the font size bigger as well.

124
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:27,830
So font size will set that to twenty six pixels.

125
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,310
And let's put the color to white.

126
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,600
OK, and then I just want to get rid of this border, one intense focus state, so let's say dot circle

127
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:48,730
and the button we want to target focus and set out line to none.

128
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,000
OK, good.

129
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:54,960
Let's see.

130
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:00,010
So each one has one has an idea of open, one has an idea of close.

131
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:02,740
So I want to target the open.

132
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:12,070
So circle button the idea of open and I'm going to set that left value to 60.

133
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:18,860
Percent, Hey, the open button is what we're going to see initially, and that's where I want it positioned.

134
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:28,470
So for the close, let's say, circle and we want the button that has the idea of close.

135
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:37,670
And I'm going to set that to top and at that to 60 percent, and this is relative to the circle, OK?

136
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,310
And we want to rotate this this close button.

137
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:52,230
So let's use, transform, rotate, and we're going to rotate it 90 degrees or 90 degrees.

138
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,940
And let's set this transform origin.

139
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,330
Transform Origin is going to be top left as well.

140
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:06,260
So now I save it and you can't see it.

141
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:06,980
It's up here.

142
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:14,340
In fact, if I take my container here and let's set just temporarily set this to 200 pixels.

143
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,800
I can see exactly where it's positioned, so just put that back to negative 100 and we should just see

144
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:27,680
the lines here and it's going to stay fixed there no matter what.

145
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,980
This image, though, let's let's just fix that real quick.

146
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,580
We're going to do the rest of this season in the next video.

147
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:46,130
But I just want to target the content image and set a max width of one hundred percent of its container

148
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,510
because that's bugging me.

149
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,810
But, yeah, you could have absolutely any content you want here.

150
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,150
And we can see the nav and stuff down here.

151
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:59,000
But in the next video, we'll finish the access and then we'll add a little bit of JavaScript to be

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,270
able to click this and, you know, add the show NAV class and will do to do its whole rotation effect.

153
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,460
Let's actually add, though, onto onto the button.

154
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,340
Let's add a cursor pointer like that.

155
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,170
All right.

156
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:17,660
So that's it.

157
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,730
I'll see you in the next video.
