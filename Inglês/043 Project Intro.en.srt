1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,770
OK, welcome to your next project.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,890
So this one, this is a pretty simple project, at least in terms of the JavaScript, it's only like

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,970
five lines or so.

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,320
Basically, we just need to add an event listener to this icon right here.

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,940
And once we click it, we're going to we're going to toggle an act of class.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,740
And it's active right now.

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,610
But when I click it, you'll see what happens is a couple of things, really.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:31,230
This container here, the nav shrinks, the links start to rotate, and then they ultimately disappear,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,570
setting the opacity to zero.

10
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,790
And then the ex does a rotation and then turns into two lines.

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,100
OK, so it's a pretty cool effect.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,190
And you could use this on any website or application.

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,160
We're going to be doing mostly CSFs here.

14
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:53,610
As you can see, we have quite a few transitions that are going to come into play when we toggle the

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,250
active class, which is what we're doing when we click this.

16
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:57,000
All right.

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,470
So let's go ahead and get into it.
