00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,000
All right, so in this project, we're going to create a verify account UI and you might have seen this

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,180
if you you know, you sign up for something or whatever and they send you a code and you have to validate

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,230
that code on a Web site or some kind of app.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,090
And this is just the UI part.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:23,240
We're not adding any kind of functionality other than the UI and typing in numbers and having it hot

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,220
to each input here, because these are all separate inputs.

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,230
So basically when you come to the page, it's going to focus on the first one and I can put in a number

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,480
and then it's going to bring me to the next input.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,700
I can put another number, another one.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,950
And then if I want to change a number, if I want to go back, I can hit backspace and put a different

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,200
number in continue on.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,310
If I want to change that again, I can change that and then enter.

13
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:51,750
And then you would have it, you know, validate with whatever with your database and authentication

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,530
and all that stuff.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,910
But this is just the UI.

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,980
So that's what we're going to be building in this project.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,300
Let's go ahead and get started.
