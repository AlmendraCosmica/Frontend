00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,480
So in this project, we're going to be building a blurry loading page or loading image, so if I come

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:14,010
to this page here, you'll see that the image starts blurred and we also start with, you know, zero

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:18,420
percent and then that goes up to 100 percent and the image comes into focus.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,600
So you could use this to load just about anything.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,550
We're just doing a blur effect on the image.

6
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,870
But you could load in your site.

7
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,690
You could have any other elements in the DOM load in that specific amount of time from when we go to

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:37,410
zero to 100 and we'll have to map different number ranges to the zero to 100 load.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,020
For instance, the image blur is going to be 30 pixels when it starts and it's going to go down to zero

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,230
as we go from zero to 100.

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,760
And there's a stack overflow function that we're going to use to help us do that, to help us map one

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,080
number range to another.

13
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:52,860
All right.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,390
So that's it.

15
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,270
Let's get started.
