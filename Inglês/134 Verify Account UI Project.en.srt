1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,400
OK, so let's start on our HTML here, and I have my browser a little wider than usual just because

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,910
of the width of the UI.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,290
So in the title, I'm just going to change that to verify counts.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,660
And down here, we're going to have a container.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:27,990
And in this container, let's do an H2 and just say verify your account and then a paragraph and I'm

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:35,250
going to just copy and paste that paragraph in which basically just says, you know, we emailed you

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,150
a six digit code, enter the code below, and then let's do a code dash container, which is going to

8
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,480
wrap around the code, which is going to be six inputs.

9
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,630
So let's say input and let's give this a class of code, except it's not going to be text, it's going

10
00:00:51,630 --> 00:01:02,220
to be a number type and we're going to add a placeholder of zero and then let's set a minimum and a

11
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,670
Mac.

12
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,360
So on a number input, we can set a minimum, which is going to be zero.

13
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:13,070
And Max, let's set that to nine and let's make this required, OK?

14
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:14,280
And then I'm gonna copy this down.

15
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,660
That's two, three, four or five, six.

16
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:23,840
So we want six total and then outside of the the code container still within the regular container.

17
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,220
Let's do a small tag with a class of info.

18
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:32,130
And in here I'm just going to paste in some text and basically just says, you know, this is the design

19
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,370
only we don't actually take your email, we don't have your email and that should do it for the HTML.

20
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:42,780
So let's jump into our stylesheet here and I'm going to use the Molay font.

21
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:57,270
So success question mark and set the family to emulate I and then say Colen 300 for the weight 700.

22
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,840
And then we're going to change that here as well.

23
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,510
And let's just add a very light background color to the body.

24
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,550
So for that we're going to do hexadecimal F, B, F, C do CFT.

25
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,310
OK, so not much of a difference.

26
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,290
It's just it's a light gray, very light gray.

27
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,410
And we can get rid of flex direction.

28
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:21,870
Whoops.

29
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,210
Didn't want to do that and get rid of Flex Direction column, which I just did.

30
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:32,100
And then the rest of that can stay container.

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,070
So container wraps around everything.

32
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:45,660
And for that I want to do a background color of white and then let's do a border of three pixels, black

33
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:53,670
and solid, and we'll give it some rounded corners of border radius, ten pixels to add some padding,

34
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,650
gives them some space in there.

35
00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:04,770
So padding will be thirty pixels and let's do a max width for this container of will do 1000 pixels

36
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:12,030
and then let's text align everything to the center and that should do it for the container.

37
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:20,700
Now for the code container which wraps around these right here, all these inputs do that code container.

38
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:29,550
And we're going to display flex, so we're going to make this a flex box, which will make all the items,

39
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,480
all the inputs, flex items, and I want a line to the center.

40
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,270
So we want line items and justify content to the center.

41
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:45,060
And let's also just add a margin to the container, 40 pixels on the top and bottom.

42
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,680
OK, now we want to do each individual input, which has a class of code.

43
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:54,590
So I'm going to set the border radius to five pixels.

44
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,830
I'm going to make the font size much bigger.

45
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:08,910
So 75 pixels and we'll give this fixed height of, let's say, 120 and a with of 100 pixels.

46
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,960
And then for the for the border, let's do border one pixel and we're going to make it really light.

47
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,960
So we'll do solid and then triple E.

48
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,790
OK, so very faint border.

49
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,620
And then for the margin, I'm just going to do a one on one percent margin.

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,860
So kind of break them up a little bit.

51
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,740
Texta line.

52
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,340
Obviously we want the numbers in the middle.

53
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,810
So text align center.

54
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:44,190
Let's set the font weight, make sure that that is set to 300 and then I think that's it.

55
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,100
So that looks pretty good.

56
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,760
We're going to get rid of these arrows here.

57
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,850
I don't want those.

58
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,360
The way we can do that is by taking the class of code, which is the input, and then colon, colon

59
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,030
dash, web kit dash.

60
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,330
What is it?

61
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,330
Outer outer spin button, and then we want the inner spin button as well.

62
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:17,080
So code colon, colon dash, web kit dash, inner spin button and we're going to set dash web kits,

63
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,480
appearance to none.

64
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,400
And let's set margin to zero.

65
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,390
So if I do that now, you can see that those are gone.

66
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,850
However, that's going to be chrome and safari to get rid of those arrows on Firefox.

67
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:38,740
We can go right into code, into the code class and use Mozi Dash appearance and we can set it to TextField

68
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:42,680
so that should get rid of the arrows on Firefox.

69
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,520
Now when I click in here we put something.

70
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:54,050
I already had zero in there, if I put a number in here and go to the next one, I want this to have

71
00:05:54,050 --> 00:06:00,790
like a box shadow around it and change the border color so we can do that by using the valid state.

72
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:12,890
So if we take the input of code and say Colen valid, let's do a border color of three four nine eight

73
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,140
DB and then let's change our let's add a box shadow.

74
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:29,230
So Box Shadow will do zero 10 pixel offsets, 10 pixel blur negative five pixel and then legba.

75
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:37,010
So the color got the X, the color is going to be black with zero point two five for the alpha.

76
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,740
So now if it has the number in it, you'll see that it has this border.

77
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,640
It also has the box shadow.

78
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,690
Now for the for this down here, I'm just going to add a little bit of style to that which has the class

79
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:51,380
of info.

80
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,440
So out of background color of E.A. three times.

81
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:05,360
And let's let's display this as an inline block because it's a it's a small tag, so it's displayed

82
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,650
in line by default.

83
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:17,960
And I'm going to add padding to it of ten pixels and let's do a line height of twenty pixels and let's

84
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:22,810
do a max width of 400 pixels.

85
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,960
So just kind of squeeze in and we'll change the let's do color seven seven seven.

86
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,070
So it's very light.

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,030
And also a border radius will make its border radius five pixels.

88
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:47,840
OK, now I do want to have this wrap because if we you know, if we make this smaller, just kind of

89
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,680
cuts off.

90
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:57,650
So what we'll do is just add let's add a media query here, so say media, and let's do a max width

91
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:00,430
of 600 pixels.

92
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:10,520
So when this is six hundred pixels or less, let's take the code container and set Fleck's wrap to rap.

93
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:12,890
So that way it goes on to the next line.

94
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,800
And then I'm also going to shrink the inputs a little bit.

95
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:25,280
So code, let's set the font size, which I think is 75 by default, will set it to 60.

96
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,040
And the height, which I think is 100, will set that to 80 or it's 120.

97
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:38,540
I believe we'll set that to 80 and then let's set a max width of 70 pixels.

98
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,340
OK, so it'll make it a little smaller.

99
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:48,620
You know, rap, all right, so that's it for the success of the JavaScript isn't going to be too bad.

100
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:55,970
What we want to do, though, is make it so when I click in here and I put it, I type a number and

101
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,250
then I type another number.

102
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,480
I don't want it to be in the same box.

103
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,770
I want it to be in the next one so we can quickly just type the code in.

104
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:03,800
All right.

105
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:11,150
So let's jump into our JavaScript and let's bring in the inputs so we'll say const codes because they

106
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,670
all the class of code and we're going to use document dot, query selector, all because there's more

107
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,260
than one that we want to grab.

108
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,340
So the class of code that will put these into a node list.

109
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,150
Now, we initially want to focus on the first one.

110
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,360
So just like an array with a node list, I can take an index.

111
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:34,180
I want zero, which is the first one, and I'm going to call the focus method.

112
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:40,370
So as soon as I do that and when we come to the page, it's going to automatically put the cursor in

113
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,050
there, because when we come to the page, we wanted to just go right into the first one and then as

114
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,670
we type go across, you know, across these inputs.

115
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:53,930
So next thing we'll do is take the codes and we can loop through with a foreach.

116
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:01,940
So I'm going to say for each code and I'm also going to grab the index of each code, each input, and

117
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,310
I want to add an event listener.

118
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,150
So code add event listener.

119
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,790
I want to listen for the key down event.

120
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,010
And when that happens, we're going to run a function with an event object.

121
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:22,010
And I want to just check to see if the key so I can take this event object and say, Dorcy.

122
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:30,830
So if that is greater than or equal to zero and I also want to check to see if it's less than nine.

123
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:36,540
So e dot key if that's less than or equal to nine.

124
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,210
Now, if that happens, I want to then move to the next one.

125
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,110
So if I type like two in here, I want this to focus on the next code and the next input so we can do

126
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,720
that by taking codes, which is a node list or basically an array.

127
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,210
And we want to set, let's say, index.

128
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,170
So when we loop through, we have an index that starts at zero, then the next one will be one, two

129
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,800
and so on.

130
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,970
We just want to add one to that index and we want to focus on that one.

131
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,910
Now, if I go down here and I do that, it does move to the next one.

132
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,480
But notice it.

133
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,880
Whatever I hit, which was a three in this case, it goes into the second one here.

134
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,280
If I hit it again, I mean, that works.

135
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:28,250
But for that first one, we want it to go in that first box so we can just add a little set time out

136
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:32,570
here and wait, you know, ten milliseconds or so and then do it.

137
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:35,450
So set time out, which takes in a function.

138
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,810
So I'm just going to take this and put that here.

139
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,530
Since it's a one liner, we don't need curly braces and then set time.

140
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:49,640
I'll take the second argument of the time out, which is going to be for us.

141
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,200
We'll just say ten milliseconds.

142
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,380
So that way if I go down here and I put something in here, it waits and then it allows us to put the

143
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,590
number in the first one and then we can keep going.

144
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:08,300
Now, if we hit delete, I want it's not doing anything now, but I want it to go back to the one before

145
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:08,480
it.

146
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,420
If, you know, if we mess up and we need to put a different number.

147
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:19,730
And so let's do an else if and I want to check to see if the delete button is hit or the backspace key.

148
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,920
So let's say e dot key.

149
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:30,920
If it is equal to backspace, which with an uppercase B, then I want to do the same thing that I did

150
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:36,280
here, except I want to do index minus one to move backwards.

151
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:42,350
So now if I do like three, five, six and then say I messed up with the six, I can go back.

152
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:49,310
However, this gets kind of messy because now if I hit delete again to try to delete that six, it goes

153
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,420
back to the next one.

154
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,550
And then I end up with two numbers there.

155
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,880
So it's still it's kind of messed up right now.

156
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,890
So this is a really easy fix.

157
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:05,450
What we can do is as soon as we hit, you know, a number here, we want to basically just clear it

158
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:08,300
out so we can take, we'll say codes.

159
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:15,920
And then whatever the current index is, we're going to set the value to an empty string to just nothing.

160
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,130
So now if I do like two, seven, six, and let's say that six was a mistake, I can hit backspace and

161
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,490
then hit another number and it will replace it.

162
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:31,940
OK, five backspace, change that to a seven, three, four and then whatever, whatever you would have

163
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,530
happen after you enter the code.

164
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,080
This is just the UI part of it.

165
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,230
All right.

166
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,240
So, yeah, hopefully you guys enjoyed this and we shouldn't end up.

167
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,880
With two numbers in any of the spaces, no matter how fast we type or anything like that.

168
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,070
All right, so that's it.

169
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,390
Let's go ahead and move on to the next project.
