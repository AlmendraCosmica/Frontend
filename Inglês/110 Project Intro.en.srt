1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,710
All right, so in this project, we're going to be building an animated countdown and what you're seeing

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:07,800
right here is basically the final message or the final state.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,280
But if I click replay or I just reload the page, you can see we get a really cool looking animation

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,750
from three to zero.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,220
And of course, you could you can make it whatever numbers you want, whatever range you want.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,500
And it's something you could put before your website loads or before your application loads.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:31,290
We just have a very simple screen here, but this could be your website or whatever, and we can just

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:33,340
click replay to make this keep happening.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,000
So what we're going to do here is deal with CSFs animations, keyframes.

10
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:45,570
We're going to be using the transform property with translate rotate scale and then we're going to use

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:53,010
some JavaScript to basically check certain conditions and either add or remove certain classes based

12
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:54,090
on those conditions.

13
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:00,420
Because we need to know, you know, are we should we add the in class or the out class to to create

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,500
the rotation or should we stop it?

15
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,520
Are we at the end of the numbers and so on.

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,950
So there's a little bit of logic that we have to add with JavaScript.

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,510
But what we do in quite a bit with keyframes, animations.

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:12,870
All right.

19
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,740
So let's get into it.
