1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,680
All right, so we're going to get started on our image carousel, so I have my project starter open

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,290
and let's head to the title here and say Image Carousel.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,700
And down here, we're going to have a div with a class of carousel that wraps around everything and

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,190
then side here will have our image container.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:27,930
And I'm also going to give us an idea of IMG s four images and then you can just put image tags in here.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,910
It can be as many images as you want.

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,970
I'm going to use for images from unselfconsciously.

8
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:37,530
These are just links to, you know, stock images.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,490
And then I just have first image, second, third and fourth.

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,670
All of these should probably be consistent.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,730
And then if I save that, you'll see we just have these large images now.

12
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,450
We do want previous and next buttons.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,500
So outside of the image container, which ends at this div, we still want to be within the carousel.

14
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:07,470
Let's create a div with the class of buttons dash container and we'll have a button with an idea of

15
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,640
left and we'll see preview for the text so previous.

16
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,700
And then this one will be the next button and we'll call this one.

17
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,500
Right.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,960
So that should be it for the HTML.

19
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,670
Pretty simple.

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,950
Let's jump into our stylesheet and in the body here we can keep most of the stuff.

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,480
We don't need to display Fluck column or flex direction column.

22
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,830
We don't need overflow hidden.

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,850
We'll get rid of that.

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,390
Let's see what else we want to do here.

25
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,880
That's pretty much it as far as the body goes.

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,180
So let's go down and let's do the class of carousel.

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,270
So this wraps around all the images.

28
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:56,580
I'm also going to just take the images themselves and I want to, first of all, set the width and the

29
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,710
height to 500 pixels.

30
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,750
So let's change this to height.

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:07,230
And then I just want to make sure that if it looks right, so we're going to set object fit to cover.

32
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,440
There we go.

33
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,490
Now we have our images.

34
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,420
We have our buttons down at the bottom.

35
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:20,100
So for the carousel, which wraps around everything, I'm going to add a box shadow here.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,520
So box shadow takes in horizontal and vertical offset.

37
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,250
I'm going to do two pixels for both and then we'll do a five pixel blur and our for the color which

38
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,000
will be black.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,710
So zero for red, green and blue.

40
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,530
And then the alpha value, which is that the level of transparency will be zero point three.

41
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,520
And then let's set the set.

42
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:51,780
The height here to five will do five hundred and thirty pixels because it has to account for the buttons

43
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,050
as well as the image, and then the width will be the width of the image which is five hundred pixels,

44
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,540
OK, and then I'm going to set overflow hidden so that nothing breaks out of the container.

45
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,850
Now we can still see part of the second image here.

46
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:12,450
So what we can do is take the image Dasch container.

47
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,110
OK, so image container.

48
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,320
Remember, that wraps around all the images.

49
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,170
I'm going to display that as a flex box.

50
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:23,510
So what that did is it put these into a flex row, which is horizontal.

51
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,370
Now we can only see one image because the image is 500 pixels wide and so is the container.

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,630
Now, the way that this is going to work in terms of the carousel, the slider is we're going to move

53
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,810
the image along the x axis using transform, translate X..

54
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:50,610
So what I'll do is set initially with set transform and then translate X, which basically means translating

55
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:53,880
it, moving it along the the X axis, which is vertical.

56
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,590
And we want to set that to an initial value of zero, which isn't going to change anything.

57
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,950
But we want to set that initially and then in the JavaScript will change this so that, you know, it

58
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,050
can move the images over.

59
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:11,820
So we'll we'll move it over 500 pixels and get the next image in.

60
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,770
That makes sense.

61
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,910
Now, we don't want to just flick flick right in.

62
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,440
We want it to have a transition.

63
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,400
So we want to make sure we add a transition property here.

64
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,790
And I'm going to set a transition on the transform property that I just created.

65
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,700
And then we'll do zero point five seconds for the duration and we'll do an ease in effect.

66
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,980
OK, so that should be it for the image container.

67
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,570
Now the buttons don't look too good.

68
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,780
So let's go ahead and I'm going to move this.

69
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,440
Let's move that up at the top.

70
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,360
Here we'll go, Underbody.

71
00:04:52,150 --> 00:05:03,610
All right, and then for the button container, save button dash container and all I'm going to do is

72
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:09,280
display flex so each fluck, each button will be a flex item.

73
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:17,020
And then I'm going to justify content, which aligns them on the main access, which since it's erro,

74
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,790
it's going to be on the horizontal axis.

75
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:24,970
I want to do space between because I want to take the space that is remaining here next to the flex

76
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:27,530
items and put them put it in between the buttons.

77
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,930
So if I save that now, it's going to put each button on each side, which is what I want.

78
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,930
So now let's dial the buttons themselves.

79
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:37,660
So you know what?

80
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:43,990
Let's you can just grab it by button if you want, but I'm not actually going to give these a class

81
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:50,020
of B10 just preference so that to be ten.

82
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:50,920
All right.

83
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:59,530
And then we'll style dot btn and let's go ahead and set the background color and I'm going to use Rebecca

84
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,940
Purple for the background color and then set the color to white and let's get rid of the border.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,100
So border none.

86
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,330
OK, and then let's add some padding.

87
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:22,690
When you do zero point five REM units, arem unit is just a multiplier of the root HTML element, which

88
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,430
by default is 16 pixels.

89
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,870
So point five, sixteen point five would be eight pixels.

90
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,050
And you can use pixels if you want.

91
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,680
Just just switching it up a little bit.

92
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:43,560
So cursor pointer and let's set the width to be almost houts do forty nine point five percent.

93
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,740
OK, so they take up almost half each.

94
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,050
And then I just want to add to the cover.

95
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:57,610
So b10 Colen Hover, we'll just set opacity to zero point nine.

96
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,130
So we have a slight fade out effect when we hover over and then let's get rid of any outline on the

97
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:03,940
focus state.

98
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,150
So button focus, we're going to set a line to none.

99
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,680
OK, so that's it for the CSFs.

100
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,420
Now obviously we want this to function.

101
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,310
We want to be able to click next and preview.

102
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:22,420
We also want it to to go automatically, to slide automatically.

103
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,860
So in the next video, we'll get into the JavaScript to add that functionality.
