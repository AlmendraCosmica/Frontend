1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,580
OK, so now we want to make this clipboard button work, so we already have our clipboard element that

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:12,000
we brought in, I'm going to go right above our generate element event listener and let's say clipboard

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,060
11 dot out event listener.

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,630
And we want to listen for a click event and then we're on a function.

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,950
And the way we're going to do this is first create a text area so we can use the document object in

6
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:33,540
the create element method to create a text area element.

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:41,960
And then I'm going to have a variable called password where we take whatever is in this result.

8
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:50,070
Hey, this is the right here result element, so we'll set that to result l dots and then we want the

9
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,700
inner text of that to be put in password.

10
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:03,690
And if there's no password, so we'll say if no password then we're just going to return.

11
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:04,960
Right.

12
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,400
So if we just click in here, it's just going to return and do nothing.

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:18,660
If there's no password, if there is, then let's take the text area dot value and we're going to set

14
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,300
it to whatever that password is.

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,980
Then we want to document take the body and we're going to pen child, meaning we're going to take the

16
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:37,830
text area and put it into the body and then we can use that text area and call a method called select.

17
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,580
So that will just select everything in the text area.

18
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:50,820
And then there's on the document object, we have a method called a command and we want to pass in here

19
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:58,500
copy because we want to copy whatever is selected and then we want to remove the text area from the

20
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,890
DOM.

21
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:07,350
So let's say text area remove and then we're just going to show an alert and we'll say the password

22
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,610
is copied to the clipboard.

23
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,370
All right.

24
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,840
So save that and let's see if this works.

25
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,400
I'm going to generate a password.

26
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,360
I'm going to click on this password copied to clipboard.

27
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm just going to go down to my console and command V and then we go.

28
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:28,140
So now we can copy our password.

29
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,910
We do like a five password with just numbers and symbols.

30
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,650
If I click that, it's copied.

31
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,090
If I go down here and I paste it in.

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,750
There we go.

33
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:40,920
All right.

34
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:47,910
So now able to generate a random password based on these selections and we can copy it to the clipboard.
