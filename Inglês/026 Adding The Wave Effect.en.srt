1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:08,100
OK, so we're going to finish this form up, so I'm going to work on the labels here, so down here

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,850
we'll just take form control labels and we want to position those to be absolute

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,480
and absolute.

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:28,860
And that's because the the form control itself is relatives or positioning absolute within that.

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,890
And we're going to put from the top 15 pixels and from the left zero.

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,420
Now, right now, the way it is, if I start to type in here, it's going to just cover the label.

7
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,920
But ultimately the label is going to wave upwards when we click in here.

8
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,020
All right.

9
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:52,890
Now, before we actually style the span, I want to add it, because right now there is no span.

10
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,210
You know, we don't have this.

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,400
It's just label and then the word.

12
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,730
So we're going to use JavaScript to basically turn this into this.

13
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,570
So let's jump into our script, J.S. And first thing we want to do is bring in our labels.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,880
So let's use document dot, query selector all because it doesn't matter how many labels are we want

15
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,770
to get them all so formed dash control label and that will give us a no list of all the labels.

16
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,030
So since it's a no list, we can go ahead and use for each on it.

17
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:37,830
And we'll say for each label, for each label, I'm going to take the label dot in our HTML and set

18
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,120
it.

19
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,250
Now first, there's a couple of things we want to do.

20
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:48,030
We want to get the inner text in our text, which is just going to be, you know, each letter.

21
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,230
So e mail in this case for the first one.

22
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,800
And then I'm going to split it into an array.

23
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,350
I'm going to go on to the next line and call DOT split.

24
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,900
And what that does, if we put an empty string in here, is it splits the letters into an array.

25
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,430
So it'll be an array with the first value will be the second will be M and so on.

26
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,370
Now from that I want to manipulate it.

27
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:19,470
So I'm going to use dot map, which you can use on an array, which now this is to turn it into an array

28
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,490
of something else.

29
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:27,150
And what we want to turn it into for now is an array of the letters with a spin around it with a transition

30
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:27,720
delay.

31
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:35,640
So let's say map and this just takes in an arrow function and we're just going to use tactics here because

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,020
we want to just turn it directly into an array of span's that we're going to have here.

33
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,410
But we need to pass in here for each letter.

34
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,830
And then I also want the index, which just starts at zero and increments for every item in the array.

35
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,520
And I want to turn it into, let's say, spane.

36
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,280
And inside here, we want to have whatever the letter is.

37
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:06,030
So this will turn it into an array of letters with a spin around it.

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,620
Now, obviously, we don't want an array.

39
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,860
We want it to be a string so we can use join and just pass in an empty string and that will turn it

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,390
back into a string.

41
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,850
OK, so basically we have the inner text, so we're looping through the label, we have the inner text,

42
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:28,380
e-mail, e-mail for the first one was splitting it into an array which will put each letter on its own

43
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,420
item in the array.

44
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,520
Then we're mapping it to create an array of the letter with a span around it.

45
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,680
Then we're turning it back into a string.

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,670
So if I save this now, we don't see any difference here.

47
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:50,520
But if I open up my elements tab and they click on the label here, you'll see that now they're wrapped

48
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,330
in Span's.

49
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:55,250
So I'm not going to add the delay, the transition delay just yet.

50
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,790
Let's go back to our success.

51
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,510
And now that we have the span's, we can add stot, we can add styling for it.

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,110
So let's see.

53
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,490
Let's do the just the span in general first.

54
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:09,660
So we'll say form control labels, spane.

55
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:20,130
And I'm going to display let's do display in line block its in line by default and then I'm going to

56
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:28,140
increase the font size to eighteen pixels because before this wouldn't have worked because we didn't

57
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,550
have spins around them.

58
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:41,640
And then let's do a min dash width of five pixels and we're going to add a transition on this because

59
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,270
when it, when we add the transform value actually we'll add that first.

60
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:57,150
So let's go up here or down here rather and let's say form, control, input, focus.

61
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,940
So focus meaning, you know, when we click.

62
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:07,720
Inside, we want the direct label span and we also want to do this on the validation, so I'll actually

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,070
just copy this down.

64
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,960
And we also want the valid state, so input valid.

65
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,290
And what we'll do is just, first of all, change the color to light blue.

66
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,400
So if I click in here, you can see the label turns light blue.

67
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,960
I also want to turn the the border light blue as well.

68
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:39,220
So up here where we did the outline on the input, focus and valid, let's do bottom or I'm sorry for

69
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:47,610
the bottom border bottom and let's set that or border bottom color rather and set that to light blue.

70
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:53,260
So that way when we click in here, both the border and the text here is light blue.

71
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:01,290
Now, see, we want to move this up basically when we click in here.

72
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:06,970
So to do that, we can add a transform and we want to use translate.

73
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:07,630
Why?

74
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:11,920
Because we're translating we're dealing with it on the Y access.

75
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,350
So translate why.

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,350
And I want to move it up.

77
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,850
So it has to be a negative number.

78
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,830
If I want to move it down, it would be positive.

79
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,230
So let's do negative 30 pixels.

80
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:24,910
So when I click in here, you can see they move up and they just flicker up.

81
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,900
It's not smooth.

82
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,180
So that's why I'm going to have to transition onto the span right here.

83
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:37,960
So let's say transition and we'll do zero point three seconds and then we could do like an ease ease

84
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,920
in, ease out.

85
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,860
I'm going to use a cubic busia, so cubic bezier.

86
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:52,030
And then for the values here, basically what this is, is it defines a cubic bezier, defines a curve

87
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,790
and we can use it as a transition effect with a variable speed from start to end.

88
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:06,460
And it takes in four points which are p0 p1 p2p three, P zero and P three of a start and the end of

89
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:07,050
the curve.

90
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:13,300
So I mean you can get a lot more complicated if you're doing like really cool animations.

91
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,500
But this is pretty simple.

92
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,780
We're just going to do a couple values here.

93
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:27,400
Zero point six eight negative zero point five five zero point two six five and one point five five.

94
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,040
So we'll have a variable speed on this transition.

95
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,570
So if I click in here, you can see now it doesn't just flick up.

96
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,990
It has that cool, almost like a bounce effect.

97
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,130
Now, we don't want the whole thing to go up at once.

98
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,030
You could do that.

99
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,100
I mean, you could leave it like that if you want.

100
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,250
But I want to have that wave effect.

101
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:56,500
So that's where the transition delay comes in, because we already have the transition and it's transitioning

102
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,000
the this right here, the transform translate where it moves up.

103
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:11,680
So in our script here, let's add onto the spane and inline style and we'll set that to say transition,

104
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,290
dash, delay.

105
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,740
Now, when we set this, we don't want to send it to a fixed value because it'll do the same thing.

106
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,810
It'll just wait and it'll flicker them all up at the same time.

107
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:28,420
So what I'm going to do here is use the index, which starts at zero, then one, two, three and so

108
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,300
on, and I'm going to multiply it by fifty.

109
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,920
So the first one will be zero.

110
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,700
Second one fifty third one will be, you know, 150, then 200, 250 and so on.

111
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,240
So now I'll save that.

112
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,690
And if I click OK, that didn't work.

113
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:53,150
Oh, we need to add the milliseconds, so after the transition delay, no, we need to have mass.

114
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,580
All right.

115
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,670
And there we go.

116
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,480
And of course, you could change this.

117
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,850
Like we could do 30.

118
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,750
We could do three hundred.

119
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,070
Which is going to be very slow.

120
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,540
So three hundred milliseconds, I think that 50 is good, though he can make it faster, like 10.

121
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,880
But it's you can barely see the wave, so I think 50 is is a good number, so keep it at 50, Ms.

122
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,340
All right, so that's how you can add this cool little effect.

123
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,350
So that's it.

124
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,760
Hopefully guys like this project and we'll move on to the next one.
