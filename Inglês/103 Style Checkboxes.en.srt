1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,040
All right, so let's get started, I just have my project starter open here and we're going to change

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,450
the title here to let's call it good, cheap, fast.

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,450
And basically we're going to have just some checkboxes, but we're going to style them to look really

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:18,750
cool.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,270
We're going to add some animation and we're going to add some logic so that you can't pick, for instance,

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,550
all three because it's hard to get a project that's a good, cheap and fast it'll be.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,820
They're cheap and fast or cheap and good.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:34,590
So we'll add some logic with JavaScript later on.

9
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,200
So let's go ahead and add here.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:40,380
I'm actually going to use an H two here.

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:48,960
So let's put an H two and say, how do you want your project to be?

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,220
And then we'll have our toggle.

13
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,220
So we're going to have three separate divs with the class of toggle container that are going to surround

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,180
the input, the label and the text, the spane text.

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:13,740
So let's create toggle dash container and in here let's put an input with the type of checkbox.

16
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:16,150
And we don't need a name.

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:26,350
We don't need a name for the I.D., we'll say good and let's also give it a class of Torkel.

18
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,490
OK, so that's our input.

19
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,720
Now we want a label because when you have a label for a form field, you can click on that label and

20
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,160
it will in this case, it'll check or uncheck the check box.

21
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,210
So let's say label for good.

22
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:47,080
So the I.D. should match the ID for the input, should match the four attribute on the label.

23
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:55,930
And then I'm also going to give this a class of label and then inside the label we're going to have

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,120
a class of ball.

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:03,280
So this is going to be the you know, the round part of the the the slider, whatever you want to call

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,880
it, that's going to go back and forth that we're going to animate.

27
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,370
So we're not going to put anything in this div.

28
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,290
We just want to have it here for styling.

29
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,660
And then outside of the label, we're going to have a span with the text.

30
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,830
So this will say good.

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,670
I will say that it's not going to look very good until we add our success, but we want three of these.

32
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:31,510
So this div of toggle container, I'm going to just grab that space that in here and here and then just

33
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,290
change.

34
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,910
The second one is going to be cheap.

35
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,340
So we'll change this.

36
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,810
Actually, this idea right here, the four and that's too cheap.

37
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,760
And just going to add uppercase here.

38
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:50,800
No, I have cheap in the last one is going to be fast.

39
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,330
So let's change this too fast and just make this uppercase

40
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,400
that and that should do it for the HDMI.

41
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Also pretty simple.

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,650
Now the success is going to really change how this looks.

43
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,180
So we have quite a bit to do here.

44
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,930
Not all, not too much, but we're going to do some animation.

45
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,960
Let's start off with the body here.

46
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:23,200
So we'll just stick with the Raboteau font display, flex line items we don't need.

47
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,560
Well, yeah, we'll keep the column.

48
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,730
I don't think we have to change anything here so we can just leave that.

49
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,960
So let's start to style the toggle container.

50
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:42,850
So the toggle container, I'm going to display Flex and I want to use a line.

51
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,120
Items here to display everything are aligned to the center.

52
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:53,890
I'm going to add a margin here of ten pixels on the top and bottom and then a width of 200 pixels to

53
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:59,140
remember the container wraps around the input, the label and the span text.

54
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,820
Now, the class of toggle,

55
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:12,000
so we have the class of Torgau, which is the on the input itself, the checkbox, we don't want to

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,060
show that because we're basically replacing that with the cool ball look or whatever that whatever you

57
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,170
want to call it, the slider, the ball, whatever.

58
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:28,490
So let's grab the toggle class and I'm going to set the visibility to hidden.

59
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,180
So now we can't see the actual checkbox.

60
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,650
Now we have the label

61
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,780
and for the label, let's give this a whiff.

62
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:48,240
We'll give it a width of 40 or 80 pixels and then let's give it a height of forty pixels.

63
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,100
OK, so, I mean, it's just it's here.

64
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,040
You can't see it yet.

65
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,500
So let's give it a background color of grey.

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,800
So we're going to use D zero three times here.

67
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:02,460
There we go.

68
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,340
We want it wanted to have really rounded corners.

69
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:13,530
So I'm going to set the border radius to 50 pixels like that and we want to set a cursor pointer.

70
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,810
So when we hover over it, we have a cursor.

71
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:21,720
I'm going to display it as an inline block because it's in line by default.

72
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:28,890
And I want to be able to add a margin of do zero 15 zero.

73
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,090
OK, so I kind of put some space around it and that actually should do it for the label itself.

74
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:44,080
Now, if it's checked, then I want the background color of the label to change.

75
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:49,630
So what we can do is take the toggle, which is the checkbox, and we can say colon checked, which

76
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:58,940
means when it's in, it's checked state, then we want to style the label and set the background color.

77
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:06,070
I'm going to set it to hexadecimal value eight E four for a D like that.

78
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,150
Now, as soon as I do that, the first one is purple because it's checked.

79
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,010
If I click it again, it's going to uncheck and it's going to be gray.

80
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,880
OK, so we can now do this.

81
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,420
Now the next thing I want to do is the ball.

82
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:27,370
We want to have that little circle inside so we have a class of ball and let's set the background for

83
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:34,540
that to white, which you're not going to see because it doesn't have any content and it also doesn't

84
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,380
have a height or width.

85
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:40,030
So let's set the height to thirty four pixels and also the width.

86
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,530
Let's set that to thirty four pixels.

87
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,780
OK, so you can see the the white square in here.

88
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:53,970
We want it to be round so let's set border radius to 50 percent.

89
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,010
OK, and then we want to position it.

90
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:09,580
So let's position this absolute and we're actually going to want to have the label position relative

91
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,690
because we're positioning the ball absolu within the label.

92
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,690
So the label then has to be positioned relative.

93
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,300
So let's add that here relative.

94
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,020
OK, so we're going to position absolute.

95
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:29,170
And then as far as where we want to put it inside the label, let's do three pixels from the top and

96
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:33,290
let's do three pixels from the left.

97
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,060
OK, so it fits right in there, nice and snug.

98
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:44,340
And it's also just a line items center and justify content center as well.

99
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:49,500
OK, now when I click, you can see it just turns purple.

100
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,390
We don't have the animation here.

101
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,910
So what we'll do in the next video is add the animation.

102
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:59,020
So when we click, it slides over and click again, slides back.
