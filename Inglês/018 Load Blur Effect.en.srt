1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,420
So now we want to work on actually having this percentage change, so we want it to go from zero to

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,450
100 and then the background image is going to start blurry and then it's going to go to clear as this

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:12,940
loads.

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,090
So first thing, we'll just bring in the two elements we have, which are the load text.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:30,210
So let's say document, dot, query, selector, query selector, and we have a class of text or what

6
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:31,710
we call loading text.

7
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,370
And then we also want the background.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,020
So that has a class of B.G. and we'll just call this B.G..

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,230
OK, now I'm going to initialize a value here called load, which is going to start at zero.

10
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:53,350
Obviously it's going to go from zero to 100 and we're going to have a function here called blurring.

11
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,970
And right now, I just want to take that load value and increment it by one, and then I'm going to

12
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,910
go ahead and just cancel log load.

13
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,600
Now, the way we want to run this function is in an interval, and I want it to run every 30 milliseconds.

14
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,050
So let's create a variable here called INT.

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:19,740
We'll say let in and set this to set interval and the function we want to run is the blurring function

16
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,110
and let's say every 30 milliseconds.

17
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:23,580
OK, this is not 30 seconds.

18
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,860
This is 30 milliseconds, which is very quick.

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,330
I'm going to save this.

20
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,300
And if we go and we open up our dev tools here we go to the console, you're going to see it's just

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:38,790
going to go from zero and it's going to increment every 30 milliseconds forever.

22
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,900
It's just going to keep going.

23
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,550
Obviously, we don't want that.

24
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,850
We want it to go from zero to 100.

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,820
So what we'll do here actually leave the console log for now.

26
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:57,810
And let's say if let's say if the load value is greater than 99, then we want to stop that interval.

27
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,860
In the way we do that is with the clear interval function.

28
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,940
So we want to pass in int because that represents this set intervals.

29
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:09,220
Now if I save that when it gets to 100, it should stop.

30
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,660
OK, so that's what we want now.

31
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,250
Instead of just console logging, obviously we have some stuff in the DOM that we want to work with,

32
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,170
that we want to change.

33
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,530
One is going to be the text.

34
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:28,290
So let's take the load text and set the inner text value and I'm going to set that to let's use some

35
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,180
template string, template string here.

36
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,190
And we want the load, OK, whatever that is at the time, and then just a percentage sign.

37
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,220
So if I save that, you'll see that this will start counting up to one hundred.

38
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,120
And also the way that I want this to to show is not only count up to one hundred, but it's going to

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,500
start fully, fully opaque and then it's going to start to fade out as it loads up.

40
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:56,570
All right.

41
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,580
So what we'll do is take the load text and set the opacity.

42
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,370
So let's say style dot opacity, oops, dot opacity.

43
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,300
And this is going to be tricky because the opacity value isn't going to be the load value because that

44
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,190
goes from zero to 100.

45
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,010
Opacity goes from zero to one.

46
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,900
Right.

47
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,250
So it's going to start at or actually in our case, we want it to start full, you know, fully opaque.

48
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:28,230
So one and we want it to go to zero.

49
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:37,080
So we have to map a range of numbers, basically zero to 100 to going from one to zero in the same amount

50
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:37,650
of time.

51
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,010
Now, there's actually a stack overflow post that we're going to use here to reference.

52
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,920
And this person asks either in JavaScript or J query to map a range of numbers to another range of numbers,

53
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,880
because that's what we want to do.

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,030
We want to map zero to 100 to one to zero for the opacity.

55
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,270
And this is the question here.

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,820
But the answer that I want to show you is this one here.

57
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,740
So it's pretty simple.

58
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,470
It takes in a number, it takes in the minimum and the maximum of the number, which in our case is

59
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,000
going to be zero and one hundred.

60
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:23,070
So the load and then outman is going to be one opacity one, and then, oh, Max is going to be zero,

61
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,570
OK, because we want it to go from solid to disappear.

62
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:32,910
So I'm going to actually put this link here.

63
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,140
I'm going to put this at the bottom of the file just in case you need to look at it.

64
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:44,160
And then I'm going to grab this function here called scale and we're going to put this right here.

65
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:53,430
And then what we can do is when we're setting this opacity, we'll run it through scale and we're going

66
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,560
to pass in the number, which is load.

67
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,970
So that's basically that's the amount of time that we want this stuff.

68
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:09,450
To happen, so when that goes from zero to 100, we want a map opacity to from one to zero, if we were

69
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,260
starting invisible and going to opaque, then we would do zero one.

70
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,030
But we're doing it the other way around.

71
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,420
Hopefully that makes sense.

72
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,850
So let's go to the page here and I'm going to save this little run.

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,280
And now you can see it's going to just slowly fade out as it gets closer to 100.

74
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,420
All right.

75
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,760
So this is actually a really handy little function.

76
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,220
Let's put this let's.

77
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,190
Put this right up here so we know that that goes with that and stack overflow is great for a little

78
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:42,920
functions like this to do a specific task.

79
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:49,120
Now we have to do the same thing for the blurr because I don't want the blur to be from 100 pixels.

80
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:51,890
I want it to be 30, 30 is the max.

81
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,140
So I'll just show you right here.

82
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,370
If I sit in the access, that's the max blur I want to do.

83
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:01,990
I don't want to set this to, you know, 100 like that.

84
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,860
So we have to map the zero to 100 to 30 to zero because we're going to start blurred.

85
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,300
So we want to start at 30 pixels and bring it down to zero when the load is done.

86
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,990
So let's take the B.G. the background and let's take style.

87
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:27,740
We want to do style dot filter and we're going to set that to template literal and let's say blurr.

88
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:35,210
And inside here, inside Blur, we're going to open up our variable syntax, our expression syntax,

89
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,770
and we're going to call scale.

90
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,570
And we want to scale the load just like we did with the opacity.

91
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,440
And it's going to be from zero to 100 for that load.

92
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,760
And then we want the blurr to go from 30 to zero in that same amount of time that that load goes from

93
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,200
zero to 100.

94
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,250
So let's save that.

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,950
And, oh, I forgot pixels, so we have to have the NUM, you have to have pics in here, so after this

96
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:09,220
expression we'll do X and there we go.

97
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,100
So now you can see that the background image is going to go from blur, a blur of 30 pixels down to

98
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,030
zero in the same amount of time that the load goes from zero to 100.

99
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,730
Same thing with the opacity of the number.

100
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:25,630
All right.

101
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,960
So that's pretty much it.

102
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,430
And of course, you could load in anything you want.

103
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,890
I chose to do just an image and blurred in.

104
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,330
But, you know, you could add other effects with stuff that you add to the HTML that you add to the

105
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,480
DOM, but that's it for this project.

106
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,140
Let's go ahead and move on to the next one.
