00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,220
The guys in this project, we're going to build a testimonial box widget and you can see that it shows

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,860
a testimonial with a user with a progress bar.

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:13,200
And after 10 seconds, when this progress bar hits the end, it's going to go ahead and switch to the

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,340
next testimonial.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:21,870
So basically will have an array in our in our JavaScript with the text, the image, our link to the

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,590
image, the name, the role, and basically switch it every time that this progress bar is up.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,820
So every 10 seconds.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,450
So we'll be using set interval to do that and we'll create this animation using key frames in the CSFs.

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,190
All right.

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,030
So let's get to it.
