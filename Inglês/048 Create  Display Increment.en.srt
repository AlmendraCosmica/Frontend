1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,360
OK, so now we're going to make this function by having it count up to whatever this data target is

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,730
and we want to put it in here.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,230
So basically the entire text of counter.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,480
So we have multiple counters.

5
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,640
That means that we need to bring it in with query selector all.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:26,640
So let's say CONSED counters, set that to document Dods query selector all all the classes of counter

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,660
and that's going to give us a node list which is similar to an array.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:34,980
So we want to then loop through that with a for each, for each takes in a function.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:45,180
So we'll say for each counter then let's first of all take the counter so that that specific element

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:51,600
and let's set the entire text to zero and I'm going to set it to a string of zero.

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:58,340
So now it's going to just show zero in, you know, inside of the div right here.

12
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,640
So that's in our text.

13
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,060
Will either you can either put something in there like we are now or you can get something from it with

14
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,230
inter text.

15
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,420
So I'm going to have a function in here called update counter and this is going to be an arrow function

16
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,040
and then we want to get the target.

17
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:25,260
So let's say const target, which is in the data target attributes so we can take the counter and we

18
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:31,410
can call doGet get attribute and the attribute we want to get is going to be data Dasch target.

19
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:33,710
Now this is going to be a string.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,790
In fact, I'll go ahead and console log and I'm going to use the type of operator and show you what

21
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,230
data type target is.

22
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,820
Also the value of target.

23
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,860
If I go down here and I open up my console, actually nothing's going to show because we haven't called

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,280
this.

25
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,710
We want to call it so outside of update counter call update counter.

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,720
And it's going to just call it once and we're going to see the type, which is a string.

27
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:04,110
And then whatever the data target is now the changes to a number, which is what I want to do, because

28
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,570
we're going to want to do some math on it.

29
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:13,990
We could either wrap it in a number constructor or we could use pass int or we can just add a plus sign.

30
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:18,460
So if we save that now, you can see down here that turns it into a number.

31
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,440
So let's get rid of this and let's create another variable called C, and this is going to be whatever

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,880
is in the inner text.

33
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,410
We set it to zero here, but now we want to get it.

34
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,550
So let's say counter dot, enter text and we want that to be a number as well.

35
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,410
So I'm just going to add a plus sign here and then we're going to create the increment.

36
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,000
So we need to decide how how much do we want to increment this by?

37
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,470
And depending on that number, that'll depend on how fast or slow it is.

38
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,490
So we want the target.

39
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,700
Let's take the target and let's divide by.

40
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,410
And this could be anything you want.

41
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,330
If we divide it by if we just use target, it's just going to it's going to increment by itself.

42
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,680
So twelve 5000 and it'll just basically just flick right on the screen.

43
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,810
We want it to count upwards.

44
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,880
So I'm going to divide it by two hundred.

45
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,400
And you can experiment with this if you want.

46
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,820
Now I'm going to console log increment here.

47
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:30,690
So the first one remember that is twelve hundred and that divided by 200 will be sixty five thousand

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,790
by two hundred twenty five.

49
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,120
Seventy five hundred three seventy three thirty seven point five.

50
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:41,540
So let's go ahead and add an if statement here.

51
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:49,230
We want to make sure that that c no, we want to make sure that that is less than the target because

52
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,790
we don't want to go past the target.

53
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:58,560
So if it is, then let's take the counter and let's set the entire text and I'm going to set that to

54
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,820
a set of tactics.

55
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:06,870
And we want to take that C and we want to add whatever that increment is.

56
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,600
OK, but I also want to round this up.

57
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,340
So let's let's do math.

58
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,420
Dot, seal.

59
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:18,370
So math dot seal is going to round this number up, OK?

60
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:27,360
Now if I save that, you can see we get sixty 25, 38, which we just saw in the console, it was thirty

61
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,390
seven point five, but we're rounding it up now.

62
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,270
We want this not to just stop on the first increment.

63
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,040
We wanted to keep going until, you know, until it reaches this, this right here.

64
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,860
So we need to keep calling update counter.

65
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:45,990
Now, if we just call it like this, it's not going to work it.

66
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:52,050
I mean, it's going to go up, but it's not going to do that, you know, the count up, the animation

67
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:52,890
type effect.

68
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,760
So what we want to do is just pass this in a set time out and we want to run it, let's say.

69
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:07,370
Every hour, not every, but we want to wait one millisecond before we run it that way, it waits that

70
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,710
millisecond, which gives it time, and then it will go ahead and, you know, keep running and it's

71
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,630
incrementing by, you know, 60, 25, 38, whatever it was.

72
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:20,930
And if you want it to go slower, you could do.

73
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,750
You can make this a bigger number, like a thousand.

74
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:31,130
And you can see that takes longer if we do, let's say ten, very quick.

75
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,770
So it's up to you on how fast you want to make this.

76
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,060
I think 200 is good.

77
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:37,430
And then I just want to put an elsea.

78
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:47,540
So else then let's just set the counter dot in our text and set it directly to whatever the target is,

79
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,380
because we obviously we don't want it to go above these numbers which are in the target, and that's

80
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,110
pretty much it.

81
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,970
So obviously, if you wanted to change changes, if you wanted to do, you know, 500000 and save,

82
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:08,540
it's going to it's even though this is this number is way higher than these, it's still going to take

83
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,760
the same amount of time.

84
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,470
It's not like these will finish first and then this is going to finish after because we took whatever

85
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,850
the target is and we divide it by a specific number, OK?

86
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,810
And then it's going to increment by that so you can set these to absolutely anything.

87
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:25,790
All right.

88
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,590
So I hope that made sense.

89
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:34,130
And of course, you could add this to your website, just a little widget, and it doesn't have to be

90
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,350
follower's or it can be any number at all.

91
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,850
And it's pretty easy to to implement.

92
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,840
So no query or anything like that.

93
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,270
But that's it.

94
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,380
I hope you enjoyed it.

95
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,190
Let's move on to the next project.
