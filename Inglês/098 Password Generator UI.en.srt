1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,880
OK, so we're going to get started on the HTML for a password generator.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:10,800
Now, when I have my project starter open and I just have a link to the font awesome CDN from KD, SJS,

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,000
Dotcom, and because we do need that clipboard icon.

4
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,090
And then I'm just going to add let's save for the title here.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:29,970
Password generator, and then we'll go down here and let's create a container for everything to go into

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,840
and then in that container will have an H2 and say password generator.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:47,480
So under that H2, let's go ahead and have a div with the class of result dash, not generator container.

8
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:52,860
And basically this is where the actual password is going to go.

9
00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:03,180
So in here we're going to have a span with the class of result and nothing's going to actually go inside

10
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,630
the span.

11
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:08,520
We just want that there and then we want the clipboard button.

12
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,830
So I'm going to say button class buttons, class button.

13
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:20,910
And I'm also going to give this an idea of clipboard and I'm going to use an icon here.

14
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:32,190
So I tag with the class of FLIR and then let's do a dash clipboard and a save that we get a little button

15
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,660
with a clipboard icon.

16
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,990
So that's it for the results container.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,160
So under that div, under the results container div, let's create another div with the class of settings.

18
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:52,170
So this is where we're going to have like each setting, like the password length, the if we're going

19
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,180
to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters and so on and each one is going to have a class of

20
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:57,810
setting.

21
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,370
So let's create our first one here, which is going to be the password lank.

22
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:07,880
I'm going to use a label here, get rid of that, say, password length.

23
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,500
And this is going to be an input.

24
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:14,610
It's going to be type number and we don't need a name for this.

25
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:21,210
The I.D. is going to be length and then let's do a minimum.

26
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,650
So minimum allowed will be a four and then Max will be twenty.

27
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,510
And then let's do an initial value here of twenty.

28
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,870
So this is how long the password is going to be.

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,310
So the next one is going to be a checkbox, actually, the rest of them will be checkboxes.

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,260
So under that setting, let's create another div with the class of setting.

31
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:56,910
And this is also going to have a label and this label is going to be include uppercase letters and it's

32
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:03,240
going to be an input with the type of checkbox and we don't need a name.

33
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,580
The I.D. is going to be uppercase and then I want this checked by default.

34
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,580
So we're going to add checked.

35
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,470
We're going to have them all checked by default.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,260
All right.

37
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,300
So if I save that, you can see the checkbox.

38
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,630
Now, the rest of these, there's going to be three more checkboxes.

39
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,320
So I'm going to just copy this down.

40
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,380
That's to want four altogether, three, four and under uppercase.

41
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,880
We're going to do lowercase.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:39,330
So we'll take that and that change it to lowercase and then, whoops, I wanted to do that.

43
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:50,820
The second one, so this will be lower case and then after that we'll do numbers, so this and this

44
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:54,870
will be numbers and then symbols.

45
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,740
So this and this will be symbols.

46
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:00,180
All right.

47
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:07,560
So include Sweeney's password length, include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, including numbers,

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:07,980
letters.

49
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,960
That doesn't make sense.

50
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,590
Let's get rid of the word letters and then include symbols.

51
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,560
OK, and then after that, we just want to button.

52
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:23,100
So we want to go now outside of the settings container, which is this right here and here.

53
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,870
And let's create our button.

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,850
So we'll say button.

55
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:36,990
I'm going to give it a class of B10 and also BTE and B10 Dash large and I'm going to give you an idea

56
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:43,560
of generate and then we'll just say generate password.

57
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,750
OK, so that's the HTML.

58
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:52,980
So let's jump over to our stylesheet and I'm going to use the Mully font, which we've used quite a

59
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:53,270
bit.

60
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,340
So let's say success.

61
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:11,060
Questionmark family equals Muli, and then let's add that to our body Phonte family, and then we're

62
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,180
going to add a background color to the body.

63
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:22,760
So background color is going to be the hexadecimal value of three B three, B, nine eight.

64
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,310
So we'll have this blue background and then the color of the text is going to be white.

65
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:37,110
And then let's see, so we want to display flex flex column, let's add we'll just add padding here

66
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,790
as well, 10 pixels.

67
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:50,550
And then for the H2, I'm going to just set a margin of 10 pixels top and bottom or 10 pixels, top

68
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,770
zero, left and right.

69
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,600
Let's do 20 on the bottom and just make sure we text a line to the center.

70
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,930
Now, the container.

71
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,170
Remember, that wraps around everything.

72
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:13,590
So I'm going to set on a container, a background color of let's do two, three, two, three, five,

73
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,320
be on that and then let's do a box shadow as well.

74
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:28,770
So say box shadow and let's do for the offsets zero pixels, two pixels for the blur value, 10 pixels

75
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:37,290
and I'll be a I'm going to do white so two five five four red, green, blue and then for the alpha

76
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,440
will do zero point two.

77
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:47,790
So it gives a kind of a light, you see the light box shadow and then for the padding we'll just do

78
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:58,050
20 pixels all around and let's set a fixed width of three hundred and fifty pixels and let's set a max

79
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,330
width of one hundred percent.

80
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,150
All right.

81
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,800
So now we have the main container.

82
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:11,400
Now the results container, which I believe goes around this right here is a span, should be a span.

83
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,500
And then we have our clipboard.

84
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,440
So let's style result dash container.

85
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:29,400
Or did I call it a result of results, a result, container wraps around, spin result in the button

86
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,870
and for a result container?

87
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:45,240
Let's set a background color of our Giba Black and STOO zero point four, and then I'm going to display

88
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,350
flaks.

89
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,240
So all we have is the clipboard icon, the button and the span.

90
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,110
So now those are in Aflex row.

91
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:57,870
Let's justify content to the beginning.

92
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:10,860
So Fleck's dash start and then let's align items center and then I'm going to position this relative

93
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:19,260
and it's because I want to position the button inside of it absolute and then the font size.

94
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:30,570
Let's increase that to 18 pixels and then we're going to set the letter spacing to one pixel and the

95
00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:38,400
padding will set to twelve on the top and bottom and ten, just not twenty ten on the left and right.

96
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:46,740
OK, we'll give it a fixed height of fifty and a width of one hundred percent.

97
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,500
All right.

98
00:08:49,530 --> 00:09:00,030
Now for the C, we have a span with a class of results and actually I want that to be an I.D., not

99
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:03,860
a class, because we're going to insert it from the JavaScript.

100
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:10,320
Then we're going to inserted into there and I'm going to grab it by the get element by D but I do want

101
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:19,350
to just add to that, let's say result container I.D. results and I'm going to set the word wrap to

102
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:29,310
break word and then for the Emacs with I'm actually just going to use Calc here, so say Calc and we

103
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:35,280
want to take 100 percent and I'm going to subtract 40 pixels from that.

104
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:39,570
And the reason for that is because the button is going to be 40 pixels and we don't want the result

105
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:44,260
to go behind the button in this clipboard button is actually going to be positioned over here.

106
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:49,770
Now, both of these the clipboard in this button, the generate button, both have a class of BTN.

107
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:56,640
So I'm going to style that first and then we'll we'll style the clipboard button itself or position

108
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,300
it and stuff.

109
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:03,630
So as far as the button goes, BTN, I'm going to set border to none, so we'll get rid of that and

110
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:06,720
then let's set the background.

111
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,910
Color is going to be this right here, this three B three B nine eight.

112
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:23,250
And then the color is going to be white and set the font size to sixteen pixels and let's set some padding.

113
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,190
Padding will be eight pixels, top and bottom, twelve pixels left and right.

114
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,660
And let's set the cursor to a pointer.

115
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,260
All right.

116
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:40,260
So we style styling both of these because they both have that B10 class, this one has a class of BTN

117
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,950
large.

118
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,690
So I'm just going to add down here, BTM Dash large and I just want to instead of inline, display it

119
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:53,880
as a block and let's set the width to one hundred percent so it goes across the entire thing.

120
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,350
All right.

121
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,300
Now for this, for the clipboard button that's in the result container.

122
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,990
So what we'll do is take the result container BTN and I'm going to make that a little bigger.

123
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:14,220
Actually it's position at first, so position it absolute and we're positioning it absolute inside of

124
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,780
the result container, which we set to position relative.

125
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:24,360
When you want to position something absolute within a certain element, that container element has to

126
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:32,070
be relative and I want to set it from the top five pixels and from the right five pixels.

127
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:42,250
Uh, yeah, so we just want to change and make this a little bigger, so we're going to set the width

128
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,670
and the height to 40 pixels on this.

129
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,870
So height, 40 pixels.

130
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,550
There we go.

131
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:56,760
And then let's also increase the font size to 20.

132
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,030
All right.

133
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,340
So that looks pretty good.

134
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:07,650
Now, this stuff here, these these all have a class of setting.

135
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,390
So I want to fix how that looks.

136
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,610
So let's go.

137
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:23,480
I will just go down to the bottom here and say setting and I'm going to display Flex because the setting

138
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:27,900
has what it has, the label and the input.

139
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:32,330
So now each setting is a flex box.

140
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:38,780
And I want to take the I want to take the remaining space that is the horizontal space and set it in

141
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,740
between the both.

142
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,050
So we'll see space between and that will push everything, you know, over to the side because the remaining

143
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,360
space is now between the two flex items.

144
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,750
And then I just want to align itself.

145
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:59,780
I want to align items center on the horizontal axis, I'm sorry, on the vertical axis and just set

146
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,490
a margin to split them up.

147
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:05,450
Let's do 15 pixels on the top and bottom like that.

148
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:06,800
All right.

149
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,300
So I think that looks pretty good.

150
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,010
Yeah, looks good.

151
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:22,200
So when we generate the password, it'll show up here and the reason I did this, this smacks with Calc

152
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,450
on the result that is going to go on here.

153
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,590
So you're saying Max with will be 100 percent of this whole thing, but minus 40 pixels because the

154
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:35,640
width of the button is 40 pixels and we don't want it to, you know, run into that.

155
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,490
So now we have our design.

156
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:42,650
We have the, you know, the look of this, but we still have to make it function.

157
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,810
So in the next video, we're going to start on the JavaScript.
