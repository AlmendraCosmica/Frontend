1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,400
OK, so we should be able to get the Temel on the CSFs done here now, ultimately all we're going to

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:11,300
have in the TML is an add button to add a note and then the note will be put in via JavaScript.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:16,350
But for now, like with many other projects, we're going to just type out the HTML first so we can

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,320
style it and then we'll get rid of it.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,600
We'll make it dynamic so we can insert a note with the JavaScript.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:27,830
Now I have my project starter and I have a link to the font awesome CDN so that we can use icons.

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,010
There's one other small library we're going to use called Markt.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:38,520
So I'm going to go to NJ Ask.com and just search for Markt, which allows us to use markdown.

9
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,790
It will allow us to use markdown in our notes.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,750
So if we want to make something bold, we can, you know, surround it in asterisks.

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,630
We can create lists and headings and stuff like that.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:53,790
So I'm going to just copy the script tag here and I'm going to put it right above the script.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,540
Yes.

14
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,510
OK, so we're just going to include that CDN and then we'll be able to use the marked library.

15
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,560
Now, as far as the HTML goes, like I said, we're going to have an add, but actually it's out of

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,320
title first.

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,100
So just call this notes app and then we're going to have our add button.

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,330
So it'll be a button.

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,910
Let's give it a class of add and an idea of add and then it's going to use font.

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,360
Awesome.

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,800
So we'll do an ID tag with Faez in the class of a dash plus which will give us a little plus sign and

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,610
after that we'll say add note.

23
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,130
OK, so that gives us a button.

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,610
Now like I said, we're going to be inserting notes through JavaScript, but for now we'll go ahead

25
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,360
and just type it out so it'll have a class of note, each one.

26
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,540
And then inside here we're going to have a class of tools.

27
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,690
And this is where the edit and delete buttons are going to go.

28
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:54,900
So we're going to say, button, let's give us a class of edits and inside here will have an icon.

29
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:01,830
So IFRS and then F.A.A. dash edits and it's just going to be the icon.

30
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:09,030
No text, then the copy that down and this is going to be a trash dash ALZ and the class for this button

31
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,740
will be delete.

32
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:11,810
All right.

33
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,200
So now we have our added delete button for our note underneath Tool's.

34
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:24,210
We're going to have a div and the way this will work is will have a div and then we'll have a text area

35
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,310
and get rid of all this stuff.

36
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,340
And depending on the state of the note, it d may or may not have a class of hidden.

37
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:38,910
So I'm going to add a class here of hidden, which is just going to be basically display none and I'm

38
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,500
going to leave it off the text area so it'll be active by default.

39
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,070
But like I said, these notes are going to be put in through JavaScript and these classes will be dynamic

40
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,800
depending on if there's text or not.

41
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,240
So that should do it for the HTML.

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:02,340
Let's jump into the stylesheet here and we're going to use the Poppins font with a weight of 200 and

43
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:11,490
400 and will replace this Poppins, OK, and then display flaks.

44
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:18,660
We don't need Flex Direction column, but I am going to set Flex wrap and set that to wrap so that the

45
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,630
notes will go on to the next line when needed.

46
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:30,600
And then let's see, we don't really need to do the A line items or the justify content or the height

47
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:34,050
or the overflow because we might have scroll bars.

48
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:41,460
If we have enough notes, margin zero will keep that and then I'm going to add some padding to the top.

49
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,620
We'll do three REM units for that.

50
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,180
All right.

51
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,970
Now the add button.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,930
Let's do that.

53
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,290
So this I'm actually going to position this fixed into the into the body.

54
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:01,140
So let's say position fixed and then let's put this from the top.

55
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:09,000
We'll do one room, which is just a multiplier of the the root HTML element, which by default is sixteen

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,690
pixels.

57
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,320
So we're seeing top sixteen pixels from the top and also from the right.

58
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,090
OK, so it's going to put that right there.

59
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:27,690
Now we want to style this, so let's add a background color to this and we're going to use the hexadecimal

60
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:35,610
value of nine c eight six to go down here a little bit.

61
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,580
Let's take away the border border none.

62
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,270
Let's add a border radius of, say, three pixels and then four padding.

63
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,070
We'll do zero point five REM top and bottom one left and right.

64
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:56,040
And let's make the color white, which will actually move up here.

65
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,610
And then let's do the cursor pointer.

66
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:04,400
And that should do it, so we have our ad note button up in the corner.

67
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,710
Now we want to style the note, which has a class of note.

68
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:19,660
So let's say note, and I'm going to set the background color to white and then let's do a box shadow.

69
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:32,590
And for the box shadow, the offsets will set to zero 10 pixel for pixel and then Najiba Black with

70
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:38,530
zero point one alpha gives it a slight shadow and then let's add some margin.

71
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:46,160
So 30 pixels top and bottom, 20 pixels left and right, and then let's set height.

72
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,190
So a fixed height of 400 pixels and a width of 400 pixels.

73
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,930
And of course you could change this stuff if you'd like.

74
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,090
All right.

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,410
So that's kind of the outline of the of the note.

76
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,890
Now, for this part, here we have the edit and delete button.

77
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,270
Remember, that has a class of tools.

78
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,590
So let's say note tools and go ahead style that area.

79
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:20,650
So it's going to have a background color of hexadecimal, nine E, C, eight, six to also give a background

80
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:29,200
and then let's display flex so the buttons will be flex items and then we're going to justify the content

81
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,480
to flex and that'll put them over to the right.

82
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:40,090
And let's add some padding to the flex container to the tools.

83
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,360
So the zero point five REM.

84
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,660
OK, now we want to style the buttons as well.

85
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:51,610
So let's see note and then the tools class and then the button for the buttons inside.

86
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:56,350
Let's give them a background color of transparent.

87
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,360
Let's get rid of the border.

88
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,470
So border none.

89
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:08,890
Let's make the color white and let's set the cursor to be a pointer.

90
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:17,920
I'm also going to change the font size to one ram and add a margin left of a half ram.

91
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:28,160
All right, so I think that looks pretty good for our buttons now for the text area, let's say notes,

92
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,760
text area.

93
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,060
So I want to get rid of any outline.

94
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,360
So outline none.

95
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:48,560
And let's make sure the family is inherited and let's set the font size to one point to room and set

96
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,300
the border to none.

97
00:07:51,860 --> 00:08:00,050
OK, and then we'll set the height to 400 pixels, which is the same as the note, and the width will

98
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:03,500
just set to 100 percent of its container, which is the note.

99
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,790
And then padding.

100
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,020
I'm going to add 20 pixels padding so it's not right up against the edge.

101
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,140
So now we can, you know, type in this text area.

102
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,720
One thing that I realize, though, I forgot to add the background color to the body.

103
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:23,080
So let's go up here and add background color and I'll set that to a light blue.

104
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:27,480
So it's going to be seven BD a F three for that.

105
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,960
OK, so that gives it some contrast.

106
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,290
And then the last thing is just didn't want to do that.

107
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:43,520
The last thing is to add a class of hidden and hidden is just going to be display none, which will

108
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,060
be able to add to the elements that we need to later on.

109
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:54,860
OK, now if we add another note, like if I take this whole div right here and just copy it down a couple

110
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:58,130
of times, you'll see that it'll add more notes.

111
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,520
And if I make this bigger, it's going to, you know, align horizontal, but it'll wrap when we when

112
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,540
we're on smaller screen.

113
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,290
So it's pretty much, you know, inherently responsive.

114
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:15,770
So we'll just leave it as is and now we can get rid of let's just undo that and that.

115
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:19,520
And I'm just going to leave one of these notes here for now.

116
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:23,890
But ultimately, we won't need it here because it's going to get inserted when we click add node.

117
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,800
OK, so we'll get into the JavaScript to be able to do that next.
