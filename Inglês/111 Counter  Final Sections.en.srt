1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,830
All right, so we're going to get started here, I have the final project open and you'll see that there's

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,920
basically two screens or two states.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,680
We have the countdown and then we have this final message.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:16,500
So we're going to start off with the HTML, creating those two sections and then we'll go ahead and

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,730
we'll start to style it.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:24,810
So I just have my project starter boilerplate open here and I'm just going to change the title to,

7
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:31,100
let's say, animated countdown and get rid of that H1.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,660
So basically, like I said, we have two sections.

9
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,000
We have the counter.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,720
So that's going to be the numbers and that's going to be the heading that says get ready.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,880
And then under that so under that closing div, we're going to have a class of final, which is going

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,700
to be that, you know, the button, the replay and so on.

13
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:56,010
So inside counter, we want to have a class called Nums, OK, Nums.

14
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:59,220
So that's going to wrap the numbers which are going to be in Span's.

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,470
So there's going to be four altogether.

16
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:09,240
So we'll create four spans with the numbers, three to one and zero.

17
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,190
And what we want to do here, since we only want one number to show at a time, we're going to have

18
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:16,560
a class of N and whatever.

19
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,720
Ultimately, whatever number has that class is going to be the number that comes in that's showing,

20
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,290
OK, now under these spans and then under this div, we're just going to have in each four and we're

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,970
just going to say get ready.

22
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:39,330
And then down here in the final class here, this div we're going to put in, each one says go and we're

23
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,730
going to have a button to replay it.

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:47,280
So I'm going to give this an idea of replay so we can grab on to it in the JavaScript later on and we'll

25
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,270
just say replay.

26
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:49,080
All right.

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,830
So that should be it.

28
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:56,700
Now we can see both sections, the counter and final right now, but we're going to only show one at

29
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,070
a time and we'll do that from within the success.

30
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,280
So let's jump into the styling.

31
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:10,350
So as far as the the the base styling here, one thing I'm going to do is get rid of the flex.

32
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,460
We are going to have everything centered, but we're going to do it in a different way.

33
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,900
We're going to use Tranz, Transform, Translate so we can get rid of these lines here.

34
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,950
And then the only other thing I want for the body is just to zero out the margin.

35
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,830
OK, now everything's going to get pushed up to the side.

36
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,070
So let's start off here with the counter.

37
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:35,690
So for the counter, I'm going to set the position to fixed.

38
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:40,730
OK, so this is another way you can center things when you set this to fixed, which just sets it fixed

39
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:46,430
within the browser window and we can set the positioning to top.

40
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,100
I'm going to set it to 50 percent from the top and then let's say we want it to go 50 percent from the

41
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:52,640
left.

42
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,400
So this puts it in the middle.

43
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:59,840
However, when you do this, it puts the edge, the left edge in the top, in the middle.

44
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,280
So it starts here.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,190
We want this entire thing to be shifted over and up into the you know, so the middle of this is in

46
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,350
the middle of the screen.

47
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,480
So to do that, we use transform and then we can use translate.

48
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:19,940
So translate without X or Y, we can we can do both X and Y values in here.

49
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,850
And for both of those, we want to do negative 50 percent.

50
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,810
And you'll see that once I save, it gets shifted up and over so that this is directly in the middle.

51
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:35,060
And I just want to also text a line to the center.

52
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:43,200
OK, so now we have that good, so the next thing we'll do is let's position this.

53
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:49,920
So this is the final class, so we'll go ahead and say final and let's do the same thing.

54
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,420
I'm actually going to copy.

55
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:53,670
Let's see.

56
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:58,820
Let's just copy all of this, OK?

57
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,120
That's going to basically position it in the same place as the counter.

58
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,530
Now, as I said, we only want to show one of these at a time.

59
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,330
So the way that this is going to work is the counter.

60
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:15,750
The div that has the class of counter will also at times have the class of hide for when we want to

61
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,250
hide it.

62
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:23,580
So let's go ahead and add the styling for the Hyde class and the way that I want this to to to basically

63
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,000
hide it is to scale it down to zero.

64
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,810
So and I'll actually show you.

65
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,960
So as soon as this count ends, watch what happens.

66
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:39,580
See how it kind of scales down and out and then this scales up, so it kind of comes from nowhere.

67
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,160
So that's what I want to do.

68
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,420
And the way I'm going to do it is on this side.

69
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:52,580
We're going to set transform and we want to just position it correctly again with translate and then

70
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,250
negative 50 percent on the X and Y.

71
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,760
But we also want to add a scale so we can use multiple transforms here.

72
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:07,580
So in addition to translate, we can use scale and we want to scale it down to zero to nothing and we

73
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,520
want it to have an animation.

74
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:17,210
So call this animation hide and we'll see point two seconds for the duration and then ease.

75
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,520
Let's to ease out.

76
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,320
For that and I get to put my semicolon here.

77
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:33,460
So now if I apply the Hyde class right here to the div with the class of counter, I can see that that

78
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,600
that one away.

79
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:45,290
Now for the animation, we're going to use a key frame, so it's a keyframes and we called it hyd,

80
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:51,440
call it whatever you want, just make sure it matches this and we're going to have something happen

81
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,370
at zero percent.

82
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,520
So basically, when it starts and then when it finishes at 100 percent, so at zero percent, we're

83
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,180
going to just grab this transform.

84
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,080
So that's the default state, right.

85
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:12,830
So scale zero and then I'm sorry, scale one is the default state and then we want it to hide.

86
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,250
So then we want to set it to scale zero.

87
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,840
So we're just giving it a smooth.

88
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:29,810
You can see right here how it just kind of fades and fades out but goes in now for this for this final.

89
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,520
It's going to work in the opposite way with counter.

90
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,240
It's going to show by default.

91
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:40,670
And then we can dynamically add this hyd class, which I'm going to remove right now with final.

92
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:43,580
We're going to actually have it not shown by default.

93
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,680
And then when we apply a class of show that we'll show it.

94
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:52,420
So I'm going to set the scale by default to zero, which will make it go away.

95
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:58,460
And then what we'll do is we'll have a final a show class on that same div.

96
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,050
And I'm just going to copy what I have here in the hide.

97
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:13,070
And instead of square starting off at scale zero, we want to want this to be scale one because we're

98
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,760
showing it.

99
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:14,620
All right.

100
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,450
We are going to call an animation here as well to show it because we want that same kind of effect,

101
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,210
that animated scale effect.

102
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,390
So let's create

103
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,620
keyframes show.

104
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:37,090
So I'm just going to actually copy these to zero percent and 100 percent, but we're also going to add

105
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,800
at 30 percent, I just want to scale it up a little bit so it'll have like that.

106
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,310
You know, it'll scale up just for a second and then scale back down.

107
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,530
So let's grab this.

108
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:55,200
So for zero percent, we want that to be zero, OK, because remember, we're showing it.

109
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,520
So we're starting with it hidden and then we're going to scale it up to one point four.

110
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,910
So a little more than, you know, the default one.

111
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,830
And then finally, we'll end up at one.

112
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:16,050
So let's save that now, if we apply the class of show here, you see how it came in when I when I keep

113
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,880
saving, you can see the effect, OK?

114
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,510
And if I add hyd here, you can see the effect.

115
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:25,560
All right.

116
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,820
But we'll be applying those with JavaScript.

117
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,550
So I'm going to get rid of both of those for now.

118
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,560
And we should only see the counter right now.

119
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,780
So in the next video, we're going to go ahead and finish up the styling for the numbers.

120
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,930
And then we have a couple other animations to do right now.

121
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,440
We took care of, you know, the the counter going out and the final coming in.

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,030
But we need to do this animation of the actual numbers coming in and out.

123
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:51,720
All right.

124
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,040
So we're going to get to that next.
