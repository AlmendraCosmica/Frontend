00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:01,710
Hey, guys, welcome to your next project.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,910
So this is going to be another short one, we can get this done in a single video.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,010
So we're going to have this auto text effect, auto typing effect.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,480
And you've probably seen this on what, different websites where it just kind of types it out by itself.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,530
So we're going to add this effect or in style this, which isn't going to take too much.

6
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:22,530
And then also we're going to add this speed control.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,500
So you can see it's at one right now.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,470
And if I make it to two, it's going to go a little faster.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,520
Three, four.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,960
Five, so you can see it just keeps getting faster and it has a max of 10 right now, would of course

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,640
you could make that whatever you want.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,550
So this is something you might see on like a hero banner on a website, obviously probably wouldn't

13
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,100
have the speed control.

14
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:50,580
But again, this is just to learn to add event listeners to make things happen in the dorm.

15
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,070
So let's go ahead and get started and I'll see you in the next video.
