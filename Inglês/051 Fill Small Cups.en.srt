1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,880
OK, so now we're going to get into the JavaScript here of the fun part of this project, and first

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,210
thing we want to do, like with most of these projects, is bring in what we want from the DOM.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,200
So we want all these small cups.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,410
So let's say document dot and we're going to use query selector all because there's there's eight small

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,120
cups, right?

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,350
There's not just one element we're selecting and we want all the cup Dasch small classes.

7
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:32,000
So that'll put put them all into a no list of elements with the, you know, the class of cups small.

8
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,560
Next we want the leaders.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,760
So leaders is it's the number above remained so right here.

10
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,380
So I mean, there's nothing there right now, but that's what we're grabbing and we need to insert something

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:46,830
in that.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,350
So we want to grab that element.

13
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:57,990
We're going to use gets element by D has an idea of leaders and then we want two more things.

14
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,960
We want the percentage.

15
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:11,440
OK, so percentages is down here, it's going to be the percentage fall for the big cup and then the

16
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,580
remaining is the opposite, so remained.

17
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:26,360
All right, so remained is this right here, this whole divide with the leaders in the remained?

18
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:27,890
All right.

19
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:33,860
Now, the way that I'm going to handle this is we're going to take all the small cups and we're going

20
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,600
to loop through with a foreach.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,900
So for each takes in an arrow function and first is going to be whatever we want to call each item,

22
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,290
which I'll call cop, and then we can have the index, which is going to be, you know, zero through

23
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:51,000
however many cups, so zero through seven, basically.

24
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:57,050
And in fact, I can just console log the index and if I open up my console.

25
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,460
Yeah.

26
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,540
So it's just logging.

27
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,970
It was just showing the index of each one.

28
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:11,160
Now what I would what I want to do is add an event listener on each of the cups.

29
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:18,230
So let's say cup dot, add event listener and we want to listen for a click event on each cup.

30
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,700
And when that happens we're going to call a function.

31
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,530
So we're going to add an arrow function here that calls a function called highlight cups.

32
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,150
And we're then going to pass in that index so we know which one we're clicking on.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,890
So down here, we'll create a function called Highlight Cups, which takes in an index, and then here

34
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,070
lets console log index and now whatever.

35
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,470
When I click on, it's going to show that index.

36
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:55,700
So what I want to check here is when I click on one of these, basically, I want to add the full class

37
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,660
because remember, when it has a class of full, it gets colored blue.

38
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:04,590
So I'm going to take all the small cups and there's a few different ways you could do this.

39
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,500
This is probably the easiest way.

40
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:13,820
So if we take all the small cups and loop through number for each takes in an arrow function and we

41
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:19,850
want to say for each cup now, I don't want to use IDEX here because I'm using it here, I'm passing

42
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:20,210
it in.

43
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,760
This is the index of the cup or clicked on.

44
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,680
This is the index of, you know, each one in this loop.

45
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:33,830
So let's call this one, index two, and then here we'll do a check and we're going to see because what

46
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:38,210
I want to do is not just fill the one that I click on, but also all the ones before it.

47
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:43,300
If I click on this fourth one, all the ones before, it should also fill up.

48
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:50,420
So we can do that by checking if index two basically looping through the small, all the small cups

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,970
and seeing if this particular iteration, this index is less than or equal to the index that we click

50
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:59,300
on.

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,980
OK, now if that's true, we'll take the cup and we'll add a class to it.

52
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:13,000
So we'll say class list, dot add and we'll add the full class or else then we want to remove the class.

53
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:18,950
So I'll just go ahead and copy that and then we'll just set instead of add we want to remove.

54
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,680
So I'll save that and and let's go over here.

55
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,340
And if I click on one of these, you see that fills up.

56
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,650
If I click on the fourth one, it's going to fill up up to that cup.

57
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,000
OK, so no matter which one I click on, it's going to fill up to that.

58
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,700
But one thing I want to do is if let's say I click on the fourth one here, if I click on it again,

59
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,770
I want this one to empty.

60
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,220
I want to be able to toggle the last one here.

61
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,990
So before we actually do this in highlight cups, I just want to run a check and basically say if the

62
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:56,600
if the one that we're clicking on is full and the next one is not, then we want to decrease the index

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,580
by one and, you know, get rid of this so we can toggle it.

64
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,320
So the way we can do that is by checking small cups, which remember is a node list which is similar

65
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,980
to an array.

66
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,350
So I want to get the current index, meaning the current when we click on and I want to check the class

67
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:18,590
list and see if it contains a method called contains, we check for a specific class.

68
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:24,900
I want to see if it contains full and I want to see if it if the next one doesn't contain false.

69
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:31,670
So I'm going to say, if not small cups, the current index and then I'm going to use the property called

70
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:36,770
Next Element Sibling and check the class list of that.

71
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:44,420
So now I'm checking the next one to see if the class list contains full or I should say doesn't contain

72
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:50,390
because we have this, you know, this exclamation here, which means not if this is true, then let's

73
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:53,090
take the current index and decrement by one.

74
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:01,460
So now if I click on, you know, the third and this is full, but this is not and I click again, it's

75
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:05,000
going to decrease the index and make that go away by click again.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,580
It's going to fill it so I can now toggle the last one.

77
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,340
OK, so that should be good.

78
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:14,450
Now that's pretty much it for the small cups.

79
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,820
This highlight cups function.

80
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:23,240
Next, we want to add a function called update big cup where depending on how many cups are filled down

81
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,450
here, this is going to be filled to a specific point.

82
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,750
We also want to show the percentage number.

83
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,590
We also want to show what's remained.

84
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,970
So we'll get into that next.
