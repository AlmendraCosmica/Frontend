1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,350
All right, so in this project, we're going to build a content placeholder and you can see this just

2
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:11,190
looks like an ordinary card, has an image, some text, a user image or an author image and and some

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:11,610
data.

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:17,850
So if I reload or we come to this page, you're going to see this cool gradient animation that loads

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:21,130
in about two and a half seconds and then the content comes in.

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:26,910
So the way that we're going to approach this is we're first going to build out just the card with HTML

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,680
access.

8
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,950
Then we're going to create this animation with access using basically just modifying the background

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,740
position of a linear gradient.

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,050
And then we're going to have JavaScript insert the content and the content will just be hardcoded in

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,790
the JavaScript.

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,800
But of course you could fetch the data from some kind of API.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:47,630
All right.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,630
And of course, you could have multiple cards and stuff like that.

15
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,990
So that's it.

16
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:53,180
Let's go ahead and get into it.
