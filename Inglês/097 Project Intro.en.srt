1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,070
All right, so in this project, we're going to build a password generator, so the idea is we can choose

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,110
a line of 20 by default.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,900
Let's say we want 10, a 10 character long password and we can choose if we want to include uppercase

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,880
letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols.

5
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,450
So let's say we want just uppercase, lowercase and numbers, but not symbols.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,710
Click generate.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,790
And that's what we get.

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,610
So we're going to get 10 if I change this to, let's say five and let's include symbols as well.

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,700
Now we're going to get you know, we're going to get a password with uppercase and lowercase letters,

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,810
numbers and symbols.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,460
In addition to that, we're going to add the functionality where we can click this and it's going to

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,560
copy the password to the clipboard.

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:49,960
If I just go up here and my you are albar and paste, you'll see that it'll actually paste whatever

14
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,540
is in the password result here.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:53,350
All right.

16
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,040
So let's go ahead and jump into it.

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,740
The JavaScript.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,300
And this is going to be a little more complicated than a lot of the other projects, but we'll go ahead

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,520
and take it step by step and get it done.
