1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,070
All right, so we're going to get started on our custom range slider and the Tmall is going to be really

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:05,430
simple.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,650
We're just going to use an input with a type of range.

4
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:13,700
But the styling is pretty tricky because these show up different depending on the browser you're on.

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,940
So we're going to have to add styles for all of the browsers.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:22,530
Basically Web that we using the web kit prefix is going to be Chrome and safari.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:30,240
The Mozi prefixes as Firefox and AMS would be, you know, Microsoft, Internet Explorer.

8
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,420
And what I'm what I have here is Chrome on the side, but I also have Firefox as well, so we can check

9
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,610
that too.

10
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,650
So the like I said, the e-mail is pretty simple.

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:49,980
So let's just say custom range slider and we're just going to have an H here with the same thing, custom

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,500
range slider.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,090
And then let's do a class of range dash container.

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,530
And inside here we'll have an input with the type of range we don't need a name.

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,360
The ID will be range and we can set a minimum tax on this.

16
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:13,470
So basically where we want it to start, which is going to be zero and then where we want it to end,

17
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:14,670
which is going to be one hundred.

18
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:22,320
And then underneath that, let's put a label for range and I'm going to just hard code 50 in there for

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:22,740
now.

20
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,360
Ultimately, this is going to change depending on where this is.

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,720
So if it's at the beginning, it'll be zero at the end, hundred and then anything in between.

22
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,870
It's also going to be positioned right above this.

23
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,820
And we want it to move along with this.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,890
So we'll need to use JavaScript to do that.

25
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:39,690
But that's it for the HTML.

26
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,230
Very simple for the CSFs.

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,280
Let's bring in the little font.

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,300
So family equals Plato and let's apply that down here.

29
00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:01,920
And I see so like I said, we're basically going to have to style the track, so this is the track,

30
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,260
this line here and then this is the thumb.

31
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,650
We're going to have to style both of those differently for for basically all of the different browsers.

32
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:19,630
So the body here, I'm just going to keep the same let's move the heading up to the top, so I'm just

33
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:27,190
going to position it absolute within the body and then say from the top 10 pixels just to move that

34
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:31,330
up out of the way and then for the range container.

35
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,250
I want to position that relative, because the label this right here, the number is going to be positioned

36
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,030
absolute within it and we're going to calculate the position in JavaScript so that it can follow the

37
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,770
thumb here.

38
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,860
Now, we do have some some base styles for the range.

39
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,850
So let's say input, and we can target it with brackets and adding type equals range.

40
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,880
And I'm going to set the width to 300 pixels, get a little wider and margin.

41
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,810
I'm going to just do 18 pixels on the top and bottom because the label is going to be above it.

42
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,250
We want some space above it.

43
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,300
So let's see.

44
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:24,660
I'm trying to think before we can style this because we can't actually style it as is.

45
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,410
We need to basically make it go away.

46
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,220
And we can do that with dash web kit.

47
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,100
And I'm talking about the track the line.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:39,710
So if we do a Web kit appearance and set that to none and save, you'll see that it goes away.

49
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,330
Now, we can actually style it on our own.

50
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,940
But before we do that, let's style the label actually know.

51
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,260
Let's let's give us a background.

52
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,510
We'll say let's do background image and we'll use a little linear gradient, let's say 135 degrees.

53
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:11,900
And then for the color here, let's do hexadecimal value F five F seven F A and that's from zero percent.

54
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:20,340
And then the next color, let's do hexadecimal C three C F each two to one hundred percent.

55
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,320
They are.

56
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:26,550
So you can see that this is just white now, OK, because we did that web kit appearance none.

57
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,120
So I just want to before we do the track, I want to style the label.

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,320
I just want to put it above.

59
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
It'll start off in the middle here.

60
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,970
So we'll take the range and let's do let's say plus label.

61
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:55,920
And for the label, we're going to set the background color to white and let's let's position it.

62
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,400
So I'm in a position that absolute within the range container.

63
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:08,780
And we'll say we want it from the top negative 25 pixels, so of move it up and we want it in the middle

64
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,590
of the range.

65
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,280
So we'll say from the from the left.

66
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:24,780
Let's do one hundred and ten pixels and let's give it a width of 80 pixels and padding.

67
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,660
We'll do five pixels top and bottom.

68
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:42,010
Let's text the line to the center and let's do a broader radius for pixels and let's add a little box

69
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,570
shadow.

70
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:53,920
So we'll do zero zero for the offsets, five pixels for the blur, our GBA black and zero point three.

71
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:56,320
So that gives a little box shadow.

72
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,110
All right.

73
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,030
So it starts off in the middle right where the thumb starts.

74
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,020
And ultimately, when we add our JavaScript will have it follow along this.

75
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,160
But that's good for now.

76
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,930
So now let's dial the track.

77
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:15,640
And this is only going to be four for Chrome and Safari right now because we're going to take the input

78
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,970
range and then do Colen Colen Web Kit Dash.

79
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,390
And it's this is the track.

80
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,910
So we want slider Runnable track.

81
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,530
That's what we're styling here.

82
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,300
And I'm going to set the background to purple.

83
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,660
So as soon as I do that, the color changes.

84
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:40,810
But you'll see if I go to Firefox, it's still white because we need to use the emoji prefix for that.

85
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,990
But let's do chrome first.

86
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,570
So purple.

87
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:55,270
Let's do a border dash radius and we'll set that for pixels and let's set the width.

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,090
To 100 percent, the height I'm going to set that to 10 pixels, make it a little thinner and set the

89
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,650
cursor to a pointer so that styles the track in chrome.

90
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,580
Now we want to do the thumb, which is this round part.

91
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,250
Now, again, we can't style it directly.

92
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:27,390
So let's first select it with dash web, kit, dash, slider, thumb, and we have to add Web kit dash

93
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,550
appearance none.

94
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,980
OK, so now it completely goes away.

95
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,820
But we can, we can customize it.

96
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:43,020
Now let's give it a height of twenty four pixels and a width of twenty four pixels and we'll give it

97
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,770
a background of white.

98
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,230
So now you can see it's just a, it's just a square.

99
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,150
So you can, you can add images.

100
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,920
You can this however you want.

101
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,040
We're just going to make it a circle.

102
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,420
So let's say border dash radius 50 percent, which will turn it into a circle.

103
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm going to give it a border, one pixel, solid purple.

104
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:17,890
And it's it's off the track, it's too low, so let's say margin top and let's do negative seven pixels,

105
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,380
so that'll push it up more.

106
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:27,750
And I think that's really all I want to do.

107
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,250
Now, this border around it, we want to get rid of that.

108
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,690
So let's take let's put this.

109
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:46,200
Up here, so we'll say range, and then when it's in its focus state, let's set the outline to not.

110
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:53,230
OK, so that gets rid of that ugly border and again, if you check Firefox out, it still looks like

111
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,870
this because we haven't added the prefix yet.

112
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:05,410
All right, and I think I think that's I think that's it as far as the style goes for Chrome.

113
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,190
So now what we'll do for Firefox and let's just sort of comment right here.

114
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,430
So this is for Chrome and Safari.

115
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:24,450
And then I'm going to just copy what we did here with the track and the thumb and let's say Firefox

116
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,080
paste that.

117
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:33,420
And now instead of Web kit, slider Runnable track, it's Mozi Range Track.

118
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,280
So Dash and Mosi, dash range, dash track.

119
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,650
And as far as the styles here, I'm going to just keep what we have and then for the range it's going

120
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,170
to be Mozi dash range.

121
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,070
Dash thumb.

122
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,020
I'm sorry for the thumb, not the range.

123
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,570
So it's the track and the thumb.

124
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:06,390
Now I'm just going to save this and go to Firefox now and you can see we have pretty much the same thing.

125
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,990
For some reason it has this white background and I can't figure out how to get rid of that.

126
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:20,100
So one thing we could do is increase the height on Firefox to 12 pixels and the purple should cover

127
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,580
the white.

128
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,790
I guess we could do like 13 like that.

129
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,570
You might have to kind of mess around with it a little bit.

130
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,390
Let's also add a cursor pointer to this right here.

131
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:36,090
So say cursor pointer there.

132
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:39,150
We'll add that up here as well on the Web kit.

133
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:47,690
So it's just it behaves a little different in in other browsers, so you just want to be aware of that.

134
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,350
Now, for Microsoft, I mean, I don't have, you know, Internet Explorer on this machine.

135
00:10:54,350 --> 00:11:04,490
I can't test it, but I'm just going to grab what we have for we'll just copy what we did for Firefox.

136
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:18,960
And Seiichi, so the prefix we want to use here is a mess, and it's going to be moustached track.

137
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,700
And this is going to be.

138
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,820
Moustache Thum.

139
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,210
And I mean, if you want to test it on an Internet Explorer, you can if it looks a little weird, you

140
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,310
can, of course, change some of this stuff up.

141
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,800
But, yeah, I'm just going to keep it like that.

142
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,880
So now we have the style down.

143
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,520
Firefox looks looks good.

144
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,580
I'll keep that open.

145
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,480
Chrome.

146
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,480
And of course, if you want to change colors or change the shape of this or the size of the thumb here,

147
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,230
