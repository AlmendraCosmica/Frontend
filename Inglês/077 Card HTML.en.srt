1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,680
All right, let's get started on our content placeholder project, sort of content placeholder.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,360
Now, the plan here is to just do the HTML and access, have our card, our image card content, and

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,750
then create our our animation, like the wave type animation as it loads.

4
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,370
We're going to do that within the access.

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,860
And then ultimately the content is going to come from the JavaScript, like the images, the text that's

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,000
going to get input from the JavaScript after that little animation.

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,040
But for now, we're just going to hardcourt all the content directly in the HTML just so we can get

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,200
the card set up.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,470
So let's give this a class of card that will be our wrapper class, no bootstrap or anything like that.

10
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,280
We're going to style the card from scratch.

11
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,340
So we have a card dash header.

12
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:56,970
And then anywhere where we want to add that the little wave animation, we have this animated dash B.G.

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,630
class.

14
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:04,980
And if it's text, it's also going to have an animated big text class because the text doesn't always

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,570
go all the way across the card.

16
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,260
But we want that animation to go all the way across the header.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,880
Isn't just text.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,560
That class will go on like paragraphs, headings and stuff like that.

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,640
So this is fine for the for the header.

20
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:26,810
But I also want to add an idea of header because I'm going to use IDs to grab on to it from the JavaScript.

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,860
So we'll have an image in here.

22
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,940
And I'm going to grab just a link to an unsafe image.

23
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,200
So we'll save that.

24
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,520
You see, it's just a laptop.

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,340
And for now, this is just going to take up the whole screen.

26
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,740
But we'll fix that when we get into the CSFs now under the header.

27
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:45,740
So the header ends here.

28
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:55,320
We want to have our card content and in the card content will have a card dash title.

29
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:07,710
And I'm going to add the animated animated dash B.G. class here and also the animated dash BGU dash

30
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,100
text, because this is actually going to be an H3.

31
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,200
So let's add H3 right here.

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:25,690
And fix that spelling, animated, big animated big text and also an idea of title and let's just say

33
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:30,640
Lorem five enter, which just give me five, you know, five dummy text words.

34
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,070
So under the age three, we're going to have a paragraph with the class of Kadesh excerpt.

35
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,050
And I'm also going to give it an idea of excerpt.

36
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,270
And for the paragraph, I'll do Lorem 10.

37
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,320
And still within the paragraph, I want to have three of those animated lines.

38
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,770
So I'm going to have three spans.

39
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:07,600
So let's say spane class, animated dash B.G. also animated dash BGI dash text and that should do it.

40
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,290
So inside the span, I'm just going to have a non breaking space.

41
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,810
So let's say ampersands nbsp semicolon and then I just want three of these.

42
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,760
I want to copy that down three times.

43
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,220
Good.

44
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:26,350
And then under the paragraphs these spans I'll be within the paragraph because basically you're going

45
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:30,700
to see these which are going to be the animated lines before this text loads.

46
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:37,390
So under the paragraph will have the author class, which is going to be where we have the profile image

47
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,610
and the name and the date.

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:47,590
So first we'll have a class of profile dash img and let's also add animated dash B.G. and it's given

49
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:50,600
an idea of profile underscore IMG.

50
00:03:51,430 --> 00:04:01,180
So for the image, let's throw this in here and I'm going to use http s random user dot mi slash api

51
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,900
slash

52
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:10,960
portrait's slash men slash forty five dot jpeg.

53
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,400
Slash.

54
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:26,540
All right, now, this image here, that's good under the d'Hiv, so we have the profile image Divx,

55
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,930
we're going to go under that still within the author class and let's say author Dasch Info and and here

56
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,970
will have some strong tags.

57
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,250
I'm going to give this the animated class.

58
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:46,920
So animated B.G. also animated BGU dash text and also an idea of name.

59
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,800
And we'll just say John Doe for the name.

60
00:04:50,400 --> 00:05:00,120
OK, underneath the strong tags will have some small tags with the same animated B.G. animated PG dash

61
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,830
text.

62
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,110
And so let's do an I.D. of dates.

63
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:09,420
And for the date, I'll say October 8th.

64
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,550
Twenty twenty.

65
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:12,920
All right.

66
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,440
So that should do it for the HTML.

67
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,430
I just want to make sure I have these classes.

68
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:17,970
Correct.

69
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:21,060
So animated big text.

70
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,790
All right, so if I missed something up, we'll come back to it, but I think we're going to stop here

71
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,330
and in the next video, we'll go ahead and start to style the card.
