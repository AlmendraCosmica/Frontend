Hey, guys, this is another project from Dribble, so this is by a DIKO gas bar, hopefully I pronounce

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,890
that right and this is a survey or feedback UI design.

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:16,620
And basically we just have, you know, these a couple of smiley faces with unhappy, neutral, satisfied,

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,830
and we can submit the feedback and then just show a thank you message here.

5
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,360
So that's what we're going to do.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,760
And this is the project here.

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,520
So it says, how satisfied are you with our customer support performance?

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,050
We have three choices.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,540
I can click on one and you'll see that it highlights it with the box here.

10
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:41,430
So basically, we're just going to change the class to active and I'll click send review and then we

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,640
see.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,750
Thank you with whatever we chose for the feedback, which is satisfied.

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:50,020
And it says we'll use your feedback to to improve our performance.

14
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:50,790
All right.

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,710
So pretty simple, but when we get to the JavaScript, we're going to do things a little different instead

16
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,290
of just looping through, you know, these these ratings here, these boxes and adding an event listener

17
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:07,860
on each one, we're going to take advantage of event bubbling and add an event listener to one of the

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,240
parent nodes and then target the specific rating nodes.

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,660
All right.

20
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:19,680
We're going to look at some different properties for dealing with the DOM and, you know, moving to

21
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,080
different elements and stuff like that and also, of course, the success to create this interface.

22
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:25,500
All right.

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,340
So let's get started.
