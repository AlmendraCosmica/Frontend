1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,530
All right, guys, we're going to get started on our animated navigation project, so I just have my

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,140
BOLER boilerplate here, a project starter, and I just included the dribble link to the graphic in

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,970
case you're interested.

4
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,710
I also wanted to give them credit.

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:22,690
So we'll start off here with the title Animated Navigation and the time I was going to be pretty simple.

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:28,040
So we want to get rid of that and have a NAV tag that's going to wrap everything.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,830
Now, the way that this animation is going to work is when we click this.

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,330
This is in the state of active.

9
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,910
So basically we'll have a class of active on the NAV when we click that in the JavaScript, it's going

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,280
to remove that class and we have a bunch of transitions to give that effect.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,360
OK, we have this stretching, we have this go disappears the opacity.

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:55,050
Also, you can see the links are rotating as well.

13
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,010
And the X the lines turn are the X turns into lines.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,770
So we're going to add a bunch of transitions for those.

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,900
But this nav tag is going to start with a class of active because we want it to be open when it starts.

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,370
And we'll give this an idea of NAV as well to grab on to it in the JavaScript.

17
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:20,490
So and here let's add our fuel and then our ally with an attack that just goes nowhere, stay home and

18
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,900
then we'll have four links.

19
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:23,970
This next one will be works.

20
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,280
And then we'll do abouts and then we'll do contact, OK, underneath the U.S., we're going to have

21
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,820
a button.

22
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,710
So this button is going to have a class of icon and give it an idea of toggle.

23
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,330
OK, so this this button is this right here, the ax.

24
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,560
But inside here, you see that we have two lines, right?

25
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,690
So we want these two lines.

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,140
So we're going to do a class of line and we want two of these.

27
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,990
So we'll add that now we need a way to differentiate these because they're going to be rotating differently

28
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,520
in the transition.

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,320
So let's call this one, line one and this one, line two.

30
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:12,760
And that should be it for the TML, so this is what it's going to look like, very ugly.

31
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,340
So let's jump into our styling and we're going to use a different font here.

32
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:24,880
We just want success and then replace this with Muli Molly Mieuli.

33
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,200
I don't know how to pronounce it.

34
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,440
And then we'll add that here.

35
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:37,840
OK, now for the background we're going to use we're going to put a solid color here, but then under

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,490
it we'll do a linear gradient.

37
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,080
And I'm putting both just in case linear gradient isn't isn't supported.

38
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:51,730
So this will be hexadecimal and it'll be a F bsf.

39
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,720
OK, so like a very light blue and then we'll have a background image.

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:07,180
And for this we're going to use a linear gradient and we'll do the direction will be to bottom and then

41
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,750
we'll use this color here.

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,960
So I'm going to paste in that color.

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,530
We want that at zero percent and then we'll put a comma here.

44
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,350
We'll have more paste in that color again, and we want it to go to 50.

45
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,570
So from zero percent to 50 percent will have that color.

46
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:34,840
And then we want it that we want this color, this blue, which is five five two nine zero F nine.

47
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,560
And we want that to be from 50 percent to 100 percent.

48
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,690
So let's just grab this.

49
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,870
And right here, we want this to go to 100 percent.

50
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,700
If I save that, we get that split color.

51
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:55,330
Look, now, let's see, what else do we have here?

52
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,100
Do we want display flaks?

53
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:00,460
We don't need Collum display column and get rid of that.

54
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:08,020
We can also get rid of the overflow hidden items over for hidden.

55
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,610
And I'm just going to add margin zero.

56
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,620
I probably should have put that in the boilerplate.

57
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,600
So that's it for the body.

58
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:24,280
Now let's start on the nav here, so let's take the NAV tag and let's add a background, a lot of background

59
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,100
color of white, OK?

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,670
And I'm just going to add 20 pixels padding all the way around.

61
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,070
And the width of this is going to be 80 percent.

62
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,440
But that's in I'm sorry, 80 pixels.

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,560
But that's in the non-active state.

64
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:47,090
So basically this when it's active, it's going to be 350 pixels and it's active to begin with.

65
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,240
OK, we have the class active here.

66
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,780
So let's just jump down here real quick and say if it has the active class on it, then let's set the

67
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,260
width to 350 pixels like that.

68
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:00,430
All right.

69
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,770
And then I just want to center everything here so the NAV will go ahead and display flex.

70
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:16,120
We want to line items to the center and we want to justify content to the center.

71
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,890
And let's actually add a border radius of three pixels.

72
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,610
And we're also going to have a box shadow.

73
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:34,630
So for the X offset, we'll do zero, the Y will do two pixels, the ball will do five pixels and the

74
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:40,720
color will be a black with a zero point three transparency.

75
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,870
So it just looks like it's slightly coming off the page.

76
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:51,550
Now, when we remove the active class, I just manually get rid of this.

77
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:54,500
Here you can see it goes shrinks down.

78
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,770
Now, I want to add a transition on that.

79
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:00,580
I don't want to just flick right to, you know, smaller or bigger.

80
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,560
I want to have a nice, smooth transition.

81
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,770
So let's add a transition.

82
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,300
So this will take whatever property we want to add the transition to, which in this case is the with

83
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,810
the duration I want it to last, which is point six seconds and the effect which is linear, it's going

84
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,710
to be the same speed throughout.

85
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:19,540
All right.

86
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,100
So now let's start to do the the you know, the unordered list.

87
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:34,540
So Sanabel and for this, I'm going to display Flex, which makes it a flex container, makes all the

88
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,630
list items, flex items that will turn into a row.

89
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:40,780
We want to get rid of any bullets.

90
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,890
So less style type, we're going to set that to none.

91
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:49,450
And then let's go ahead and just remove any default margin and padding.

92
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,340
Oops.

93
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:02,770
OK, and then what else do we want to do here, so the with the with for this the initial with is going

94
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,730
to be zero.

95
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,150
And the reason for that is when when it's not active, we want the width of it to be zero.

96
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,610
All right.

97
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,270
Now we want to add a transition for the width here, too.

98
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:25,320
So it's a transition on the width and it's going to be zero point six seconds linear.

99
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,000
Now, when it's active, let's say when the NAV tag has a class of active, which it does now, we want

100
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:37,540
the width of the U.S. to be 100 percent.

101
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,040
OK, sorry, I'm going to put you out here.

102
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:49,880
OK, so have the with that 100 percent and then I think that's all we want there.

103
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,020
So let's do the list items.

104
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,850
So we have our NAV.

105
00:07:55,030 --> 00:08:01,790
You will list items and remember, we want we want them to have that rotate effect.

106
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:12,670
So what we'll do is we'll use transform and we can use rotates on the Y axis and start here with zero

107
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,480
degrees.

108
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,670
And I'm going to change that for the act, for the active state.

109
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,650
We'll go ahead and add that.

110
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:28,000
And by default, the opacity is going to be zero, which is going to make it just disappear.

111
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,950
And that's fine because we only want it to show when it has the active state.

112
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:40,570
And then I want to add a transform of sorry, a transition for the transform property, for the rotate,

113
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,330
because we wanted to have that smooth rotation.

114
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,140
You can see the the allies have that rotate.

115
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
And also for the opacity, you can see how they fade in and out, nice and smooth.

116
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,710
So what we'll do is add transition on transform

117
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:07,960
and let's do zero point six seconds linear and then also added onto the opacity property, which will

118
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,260
be zero point six seconds duration and linear.

119
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,300
All right, and then let's see, so when it's active, we should see it.

120
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:29,230
So let's say now NAV active and we want to target the ally when the NAV is active and set the opacity

121
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:31,240
to one so we can see it.

122
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:38,500
And then we also want to set the transform to rotate.

123
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,070
Why?

124
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,460
And we're going to do 360 degrees.

125
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:44,350
We just want to do a full 360 spin.

126
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:51,510
You can see when I save it actually shows us the transition or the rotation, I should say.

127
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,780
All right.

128
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:58,600
Now the links don't look too good, so let's make those look a little better.

129
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:08,770
So we'll see now VLA and we want to position these to be relative and the color of the lengths I'm going

130
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:14,520
to set to black and I'm going to get rid of any underlying subtext decoration.

131
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,020
What is this text decoration?

132
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,430
We want that to be none.

133
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:26,620
And then I'm just going to separate them with a margin on the right and left of ten pixels looks much

134
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:26,980
better.

135
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:28,390
All right.

136
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,700
So I think what we'll do is stop here.

137
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,960
And then in the next video, we'll go ahead and style the icon or the button.

138
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,600
The button with the class of icon.

139
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,840
Put the lines in there and we're going to add the rotation, transform for that, and then we'll add

140
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,690
the JavaScript with the event listener.

141
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:47,290
All right.

142
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,520
So we'll get to that next.
