1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,980
So in this project, we're going to build a notes app and we're actually going to be able to save these

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,040
notes to local storage, so we'll be using the local storage API, which is built into the browser.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,140
So I have nothing here but an add note button.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:18,990
And if I click that, it's going to add this little note here so I can click in here and I can type,

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,590
you know, hello world or whatever.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,600
And this here is going to toggle.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,150
This is the edit button.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,590
It'll toggle from text area to just a regular div that shows the text.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:32,340
All right.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,480
I can add another one.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,300
Say hello again.

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,270
All right.

13
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,410
So we have two notes here.

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,060
And if I reload, they're going to stay because they're saved in local storage.

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,360
If I delete this, I reload.

16
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,700
It's going to stay the same because, again, it's being saved to the browser.

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,380
It's being saved in local storage.

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:58,020
Another thing we can do is use markdown because we're going to be using a small library called Markt.

19
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,440
So if I want this to be a heading, I could do a number sign.

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,810
I'm not going to go through all the markdown syntax, but you can look up that.

21
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:07,910
You can look at that on your own.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,410
I do have a crash course on YouTube, on markdown.

23
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,730
If we want to do like an unordered list, we could do like hyphen space.

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,550
And if we take a look at that outside of edit mode, we have a heading and an list list.

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,390
OK, if I reload is going to stay because again, being saved.

26
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,480
So I think it's a it's a pretty neat application if you're learning, you know, local storage and how

27
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,630
to work with the DOM, add and remove things and so on.

28
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:34,430
All right.

29
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,300
So let's go ahead and get started.
