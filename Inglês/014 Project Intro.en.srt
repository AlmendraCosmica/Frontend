00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,640
OK, so this is going to be one of the shortest projects in this course, but it's a cool little widget

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,050
that you can add to your website or to your application.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,080
It's a hidden search.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,790
And we just have this button here with a little search icon from font.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,330
Awesome.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,230
And as soon as I click it, if I was offered JavaScript event, that activates a specific class where

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:29,280
we add a transition for the width of this input to get wider and the button to move over using a transform

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,970
translate X, and if I click it again, it's going to shrink back up.

9
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,690
OK, so we'll be using CSFs transitions along with just a little bit of JavaScript to add the event

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,060
and toggle the class.

11
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,460
All right, so let's get started.
