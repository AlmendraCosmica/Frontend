1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,860
So in this project, we're going to be building a movie app and we're going to be using a third party

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:13,590
API from the movie DB Dog, which gives you, you know, a giant database of movies with the title and

3
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,720
ratings and images and just a whole bunch of data that we can work with.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,220
So we're going to, first of all, create the UI, you know, add the e-mail access that we're going

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,960
to register an API key with the the TMD DB service.

6
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,930
We're going to add the JavaScript to make a request to get the data to show the most popular movies

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,380
at the time, which is what you can see here.

8
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,700
We're going to have this hover effect where it shows you the overview of each movie, shows you the

9
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,270
rating.

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,880
We're going to have special colours depending on what the rating is.

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,510
So if it's like above eight, it'll be green.

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,970
If it's between five and eight, it'll be orange.

13
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,250
If it's below five, it'll be red.

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:56,100
OK, and we're also going to add the search functionality.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,650
If I search for the word hard and enter, it's going to get me all the movies with the title, with

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,110
the word hard, or at least the first 20 or 30.

17
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:09,000
If I search for, let's say, over, see, I'll get movies with over.

18
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,180
So it's it's not a giant application, but it gives you a good idea on, you know, using the fetch

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:22,770
API, working with a third party data service or data API and also putting that stuff into the DOM,

20
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,780
adding the data to the DOM to the page.

21
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,800
So that's it.

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,970
Let's go ahead and get started.
