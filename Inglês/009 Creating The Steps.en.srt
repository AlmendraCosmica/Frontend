1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,000
All right, so we're going to jump into our HTML and it's going to change the title to progress steps

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,280
and in the body here, we're going to want a container around everything.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,120
And then inside that container, we'll have a progress Dasch container and then inside there, we'll

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,440
have a class of progress.

5
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,290
I'm also going to give it an idea of progress, OK?

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,640
And nothing is going to go inside here.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,980
We're just going to use it for for styling and for creating the line.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:33,030
And now we do have the circles with the numbers inside.

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,180
So inside inside progress container.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:45,090
But after the progress div, we're going to have a class of circle and depending on which one is active,

11
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,760
it'll have different styling.

12
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,050
So the first one here, I'm going to just manually put a class of active on and this is going to be

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:55,650
one and then we'll copy that down three more times.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,990
And we don't want active on these other ones.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:06,300
And this one will be step two and this one will be three and this one will be four.

16
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,940
And then let's go outside of the progress container still within the regular container and have our

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,490
buttons.

18
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,160
So this is going to be class.

19
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,010
Let's give it a class of BTN and I'm going to give it an idea of pre for prevue.

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,460
And I'm also going to make this disabled by default because we're going to start at one and we can't

21
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,170
go previous if we're at one.

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,300
And let's just say PreÅ¡ov in here, copy this down and this will be the next.

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,790
So we'll get rid of disabled here and change the ID to next.

24
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:41,370
OK, so we'll save that.

25
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,470
It's going to look absolutely horrible for now.

26
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,270
But let's jump into our success and start to sharpen this up.

27
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,040
So I'm going to use the multi font.

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:58,650
So I'm going to just get rid of this here and say CSFs, questionmark, family equals Ally.

29
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,350
And I'll add that here and then I'm going to add a background color to the body.

30
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:17,550
So background color is going to be F six, F seven F, B and C display Fleck's.

31
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,070
We can get rid of the column, justify a line center.

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,600
OK, that stuff is all good.

33
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:34,710
So for the container, we're just going to text a line to the center and then for the progress container.

34
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,510
Let's display that as a flex box.

35
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:50,360
OK, so it's going to remember the progress container wraps around this right here, not the buttons.

36
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,590
So put that into a flex row.

37
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,140
Now, as far as the remaining content, let's do justify content.

38
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:05,000
So I want to take the remaining space here and put it in between the elements.

39
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,510
So we're going to use space between, OK.

40
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,890
So that will separate them out.

41
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,660
We're going to position relative so that we can position other things inside of it.

42
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,410
Absolu.

43
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:30,230
Let's add a margin bottom of 30 pixels and let's set a max width of 100 percent and set a width of 350

44
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:30,950
pixels.

45
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,070
And you could change this, of course, if you wanted to.

46
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,710
So now we want to start to work on the line that's going to go through the middle of these and then

47
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,980
we'll work on the circles.

48
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,630
Now, the way we're going to do this is the progress.

49
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:50,390
This div right here is going to be the blue line that that changes, that has a transition.

50
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,190
When we click next, it'll go to two, three, so it'll go to a certain percentage and then we're going

51
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,190
to have a faint gray line behind it, which is basically represents the empty line and that's going

52
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:05,000
to be on the before pseudo selector of the progress container.

53
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:05,870
All right.

54
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,170
So let's go ahead and create the blue line first.

55
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,220
So that's going to be on progress.

56
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,380
All right.

57
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,960
We're going to set a background color.

58
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:21,710
Let's set it to hexadecimal three, four, nine, eight DB.

59
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:29,150
And we want to position this to be absolute within the progress container, which is positioned relative.

60
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:35,300
And as far as where I want to put it, I want it in the middle, you know, vertically.

61
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:44,810
So let's do 50 percent from the top and let's do from the left zero and it'll have a height of four

62
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,520
pixels.

63
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,390
Now the width is going to start out as zero percent because we're going to start, you know, at the

64
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,570
beginning here, but just for now, so we can actually see it.

65
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:55,010
I'll set it to 50 percent.

66
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,440
Now, this isn't directly in the middle.

67
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,150
The top of the line is in the middle, but we want the middle to be in the middle.

68
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:10,270
So we want to add a transform and set translate on the Y axis, which is the vertical axis.

69
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,650
Want to move it up 50 percent.

70
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,100
OK, so now it should be right in the middle.

71
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:21,590
And let's also set a Z index because we want to make sure this is behind the circles, behind the numbers.

72
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,300
So we'll set that to negative one.

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,370
And then this is going to have a transition on it, because when we do click previous or next, we want

74
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,900
the line to transition in a certain duration, not just flip to the next one.

75
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:40,130
So we'll just two point four seconds with an EZ effect.

76
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,410
All right.

77
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,400
So that should be good as far as that goes.

78
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,140
Now, I'm going to just change this to zero percent with because that's going to be the starting point.

79
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,000
And I'm going to copy this and go right above it.

80
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:04,430
And this is going to be the progress container and we're going to use the before selector and then this

81
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:06,860
is going to be the faint gray line behind it.

82
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:09,890
So I'm going to use E zero three times as the background.

83
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:16,070
These coordinates are going to be the positioning is going to be the same, the height, the same.

84
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,950
The width, however, is going to be one hundred thousand one hundred because it's going to represent

85
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,940
the empty line.

86
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,990
And we don't need a transition because it's not actually going to do anything.

87
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,120
It's just the the line behind it.

88
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,420
So I saved it.

89
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,610
But the reason we're not seeing anything is when you use before or after, you have to add content,

90
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,740
which I, I often forget and just set it to an empty string.

91
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,610
So now we can see the line behind it.

92
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:52,430
Now, if I were to set this to, you know, 50 percent, you can see now it fills in that gray line.

93
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:57,530
But we're going to keep that at zero for now and let's style the circles.

94
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,740
OK, so all we have left now is the circles and the buttons.

95
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,260
So say circle.

96
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:18,050
And for this, let's give it a background color of white, and we're going to do a color of nine nine

97
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,590
nine.

98
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,100
So just like a gray color and.

99
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,680
Let's see, let's do a border radius.

100
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:37,180
Border radius, we want us to be rounded so 50 percent and let's set a height of 30 pixels and we'll

101
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,810
also set a width of 30 pixels.

102
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,520
All right.

103
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,290
Now we want to center the the numbers in the circle.

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:55,840
So one of the easiest ways to do that is just display Fleck's a line items center and justify content

105
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,860
center.

106
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,690
So those are put the numbers right in the middle.

107
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,250
Let's see.

108
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,200
Let's give it a give them a border.

109
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:08,140
So border will be three pixels solid and let's do a light gray.

110
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:12,820
So E zero basically the same color as the as the line.

111
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,720
And I think that should do it.

112
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,450
We do want to add a transition.

113
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,210
The border is going to change depending on where the blue line is.

114
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,790
If it's up to two, then that border should be two.

115
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:33,310
And that that's going to pertain to the active class, which will style in a second.

116
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:40,330
But for the transition, let's do point four seconds ease and then let's do the active class.

117
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:51,400
So circle, if it has the active class on it, then let's make the border the color and sit that two

118
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,070
three four nine eight DB

119
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:07,720
and that should be the same as or is it right here three four nine eight that we could actually use

120
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,550
some custom properties here.

121
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,360
So defiant to define custom properties which are basically just variables.

122
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,200
We need a scope.

123
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,730
So I'm going to put it on the root scope.

124
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:30,200
And let's set the wheels, a line fell and set that actually it's the line in the buffet line.

125
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,620
Water fell and grab this.

126
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,790
And put that in their.

127
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,030
And then let's say.

128
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:52,010
Line border empty.

129
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,430
And that's going to be that e0.

130
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:07,800
OK, so now we can just replace this with vare dash, dash line border empty.

131
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,720
I'm just going to copy that.

132
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,350
And this one here, this is going to be oops, this is going to be Phil.

133
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,090
So line border Phil.

134
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,780
And this one here will be line border empty.

135
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,910
That's the border of the circle, and then if it's active, it'll be filled.

136
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,650
So that way you can just if you want to change the colors, you can do that easily up above.

137
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:39,990
All right.

138
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,270
So now for the buttons.

139
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,920
Those are the last thing we want to style.

140
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,990
So BTN and this is actually going to have the same background color as the film.

141
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,290
So we'll go ahead and just add that here as well.

142
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:10,420
OK, and let's set the color to white and let's remove the button border, let's set the border radius

143
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,900
to six pixels and set the cursor to a pointer.

144
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,760
Let's set the make sure we inherit the font family.

145
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,090
So inherit good.

146
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,440
Let's add some padding.

147
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:31,000
So we'll do eight pixels, top and bottom, 30 pixels left and right and add a little bit of margin.

148
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,740
So five pixel margin and that should do it actually.

149
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:44,090
Let's make the font size 14 pixels, OK, and then we'll just have a little scaling effect on the active.

150
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:54,580
So like when we click it so btn cool and active and add a transform, we want to scale it down a little.

151
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,780
So from one will go two point ninety eight.

152
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,260
That way when we click we have you know that little factoid.

153
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,260
This is disabled.

154
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,310
Remember the previous.

155
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,250
So I can't click that but that has that little effect.

156
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,780
Let's also get rid of the outline.

157
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:14,740
So BTN when it's in its focus state, we want to set the outline to zero or none.

158
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,430
All right.

159
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:23,350
Let's also let's make it if it's disabled, if the button is disabled, we'll make it grey.

160
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:29,950
So let's say button Colen disabled because we can target that and we're going to set the background

161
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:35,530
color to vare and let's use the empty.

162
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,440
And I'm also going to set the cursor from a pointer, set it to not allowed.

163
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:47,380
So that way, if it's disabled, we can't you know, it gives us that not allowed cursor can't click

164
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,590
it.

165
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,350
So that does it for the styling.

166
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:55,060
So in the next video we can go ahead and add the JavaScript so we can click next, have this move to

167
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:59,680
the second one, third one, have it moved back with previous and so on.

168
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:00,040
All right.

169
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,300
So I'll see you in the next video.
