1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,710
All right, let's get started on our increment counter so I have my project.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:06,240
I also have a link to font.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,480
Awesome, because we will be adding the social media icons, which, of course, is optional and let's

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,350
say increment counter.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:26,470
And in the body here, we're going to have three divs at the class of counter dash container.

6
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:31,380
OK, so in this kind of container, we're going to have the icon.

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,180
So let's do an eye tag now.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:39,870
When you use social media icons with font, awesome, it's fab class instead of fax and then F.A.A.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,330
dash and this one is going to be Twitter.

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,720
And I'm going to make it a little bigger with font.

11
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,110
Awesome.

12
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,710
You can also add the class of a dash.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:56,820
Let's do three x, so three times the normal size and then we're going to have a class of counter and

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,170
this is where the number is going to go.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:07,740
However, right now I'm just going to hardcoded, but it's ultimately going to come from a an attribute,

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:15,210
a data attribute that we're going to call data target and we're going to set that to twelve twelve thousand

17
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,730
instead of two, whatever you want.

18
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:25,870
And then we're going to have a span with just the text that this is the Twitter followers, OK?

19
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,520
And we're going to have two more of these and you can have as many counters as you want.

20
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,620
So the second one here is going to be YouTube.

21
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:40,230
And this lets say this will be 5000.

22
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:51,280
And the date of Target 5000 and let's change Twitter followers to YouTube

23
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:03,040
subscribers and then this one down here, let's make this Facebook and then four followers or fans,

24
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,990
whatever will do.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:16,180
Seventy five hundred and seventy five hundred will change this text here to Facebook fans.

26
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,190
All right.

27
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:19,190
So that's what it's going to look like now.

28
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,070
Let's go ahead and style this stuff.

29
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,080
So the font I want to use is Raboteau mono.

30
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:31,840
So up here, I would say success question mark and then let's change.

31
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,570
We'll get rid of this.

32
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:44,200
So the family is going to be Rebadow plus mono like that, and then we'll change the font family here

33
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,170
to Raboteau mono.

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,140
OK, is it kind of that typewriter look and then let's add a background color here.

35
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,070
So background color is going to be a purplish color.

36
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,250
So h e for for add it will make the text white.

37
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:14,630
And then let's see if Filloux Direction column, I'm going to get rid of that, I actually want it to

38
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:19,910
be I want it to look like this, except on you know, when it's on small screens, it'll go this way.

39
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,640
So we'll just add a media query at the end.

40
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,380
So let's set a line item.

41
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,050
That's good.

42
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,330
All right.

43
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:38,000
So the counter container counter dash container, I'm going to display flex.

44
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,910
And this I want to display as a column.

45
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,780
Remember, the counter container is each one of these which we're making a flex box and we don't want

46
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,420
to go this way.

47
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,640
We want them to be stacked on top of each other.

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:04:00,440
So let's set the flex direction there to column and let's justify content center and let's add a margin.

49
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:06,620
So just to add some spacing, we'll do 30 pixels, top and bottom, 50 left and right.

50
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:16,500
And then let's see for the counter, class or counter, I'm going to set the font size.

51
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,210
This is the you know, the text that's going to increment.

52
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:23,630
I'm going to set that to 60 pixels are going to make that quite big.

53
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,570
And then let's add a margin, top of ten pixels.

54
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:37,040
And it's also a line in the in the container here.

55
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,840
Count a container.

56
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:44,550
Let's do a text, a line of text dash line to the center.

57
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:45,990
Good.

58
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,250
Now, when it's on small screens like this, I want it to go the other way.

59
00:04:52,250 --> 00:05:00,050
So let's create a media query here by saying at media and a max width of, let's say five eighty.

60
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:10,370
So meaning anything under five eighty pixels, then I want the body flex direction to be a column instead

61
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:10,940
of a row.

62
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:11,990
All right.

63
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,670
So there we go.

64
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,230
Now, we don't need to have these these hard coded numbers in here.

65
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:23,620
We can get rid of these because that's going to be input by the JavaScript.

66
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,470
So in the next video, we'll jump into our script JS and we'll continue with that.
