1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:05,610
So we're going to get started on our double click project and we are going to be using font.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:06,060
Awesome.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,030
So I noticed that I have the link, the CDN to font.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,750
Awesome here.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,190
So you can get that from font.

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,930
Awesome website or CD and Jast dot com.

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:21,540
So let's change the title here in the HTML and we'll call this double double click cart.

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,420
And down here we want to have not much.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:36,300
We're going to have an H3 here and we'll say double click on the image to and then let's put the heart

10
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:36,620
here.

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:44,720
So we're going to use an eye tag with the class of Fey S and F a dash heart.

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,480
And then after that, we're just going to put the word it.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,400
So outside of the icon here.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,580
So it'll be double click on the image to heart it.

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,950
OK, there we go.

16
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,900
And then we're also going to count how many times it's been clicked.

17
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:09,750
So that's going to go into a small tag here and we'll say you liked it.

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,490
And then spane here.

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:17,280
And let's give this an idea of times and just start with zero.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,070
And then after the span here, we'll just say time.

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,380
So that'll tell us how many times we liked it.

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,300
And then the last thing we want is just a div with the class of love me.

23
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,220
And that's basically where the background image is going to go and where, you know, we're going to

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,110
we're going to add our event listener to our double click on it and get that heart icon.

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:40,820
All right.

26
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:41,700
So let's save that.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,280
Let's jump into the stylesheet here and we're going to use a family code called Oswald.

28
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,460
So I'm just going to do Caesar's questionmark family equals Oswald.

29
00:01:55,050 --> 00:02:02,550
And for the background here in the background, for the family here in the body, let's change that

30
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,780
to Oswald.

31
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,540
OK, so that'll change the font.

32
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,980
And then we don't really need Fleck's box here.

33
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:14,730
So I'm actually going to get rid of all this stuff.

34
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:23,790
You know, get rid of that and all I'm going to put here is a text, a line center.

35
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:34,720
And then let's start to style like the three, so let's give a margin bottom here of zero and let's

36
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,180
add text align center here.

37
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:46,480
And then the small tag I want to display as block as small is inline by default.

38
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:55,250
And then I want to add margin bottom to that of 20 pixels and also text align center.

39
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,260
So for the heart we want we obviously don't want to Blackheart and we're going to have the heart icon

40
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,940
in the image when we click on it.

41
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:12,210
So let's style a dash heart and let's just make the color to red like that.

42
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,110
Now we have a red card.

43
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,870
So next we want to do the Love Me class, which is going to be the whole basically the whole image.

44
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:37,150
So for this, let's add a let's do a height of 440 and let's do a width of 300 and then for the background.

45
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:44,860
So I'm going to use a background image, actualise background, and then it's going to be a Eurail.

46
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,160
And of course, this could be any image you want.

47
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,060
I'm just going to grab this real quick.

48
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,690
It's just an image of a car from Splash.

49
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,220
OK, so put that in there.

50
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:05,520
All right, now, I just want to add a couple of background attributes like no repeats position, center,

51
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,970
center and cover, OK?

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,950
And then after that, let's just set margin up.

53
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,730
So I want to go.

54
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,420
Yeah, that's right.

55
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,820
So imagine I'm going to set that to auto.

56
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,260
I don't move it to the middle.

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,570
And then let's put a cursor point there, because when we hover over it, we want to have a pointer

58
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,070
and I'm just going to set a max with one hundred percent.

59
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,840
And I'm going to position this to be relative because the heart when we click and we have the heart

60
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,250
icon, that's going to be positioned absolute within this.

61
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,760
So this the container needs to be positioned relative.

62
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:53,370
And then let's also add a little bit of box shadow, which I'm just going to paste in case we have a

63
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,240
little box shadow.

64
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,880
Kind of looks like it's coming off the page and that should do it for Love Me.

65
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:03,420
So now let's do the the heart that's in the Love Me class.

66
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,740
So F.A.A. Dasch heart.

67
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,810
And like I said, if you want to position this to be absolute.

68
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,290
And we're not going to see this just yet because it's going to get put in through the JavaScript, so

69
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,980
we're just adding the CSFs, which isn't much we want to position absolute.

70
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:30,880
And then we want to have an animation for it, which I'm going to call Gro and we'll do that over a

71
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,280
period of six seconds and make that linear.

72
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,630
And then let's add a transform

73
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,550
and for the transform set translate.

74
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,140
So it's going to be it's going to start in the middle.

75
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,320
So 50 negative, 50 percent on the x axis, negative, 50 percent on the Y axis.

76
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,990
I also want to scale it.

77
00:05:56,980 --> 00:06:04,900
So in addition to translate will have scale to zero now for the animation that's going to go on a key.

78
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,410
So let's say at keyframes and we called it grow.

79
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,700
And what I want to do is just change the scaling.

80
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:21,880
OK, so when we double click on it, it's going to look like it's growing, you know, from its regular

81
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,710
size up.

82
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,720
So we want to change this.

83
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:32,840
The translate will be, oh, actually, I'm sorry, we need to add let's just say two, because it's

84
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,760
only it's only one point.

85
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:38,480
So two, and then we want to scale it up.

86
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,040
Ten.

87
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,250
OK, so it's going to go from zero to 10.

88
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:51,320
And let's also make the opacity to zero because we don't want it to stay once we double click.

89
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,110
We just wanted to show scale and then disappear.

90
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,170
OK, so that's pretty much it for the success.

91
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,520
In the next video, we'll jump in and make this function with our JavaScript.
