1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,150
OK, let's go ahead and start on this hoverboard project.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:11,010
So in the HTML here, let's change the title up to hoverboard and all we're going to have in this HTML

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,070
is a class of container, because in this container we're going to have a bunch of divs with the class

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,430
of square like this.

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,550
In fact, what I'll do is just I'll put some in here now, but later on we're going to get rid of these

6
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,320
because they're going to get inserted via JavaScript and we're going to set a certain amount of squares

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,870
to be painted on to the screen.

8
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:41,370
So for now, we'll just throw these in and let's jump into our stylesheet and let's see for the body

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:41,790
here.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,560
Let's set a background and I'm going to set that to one.

11
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,100
One, one.

12
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,740
So, I mean, it doesn't really matter, but we're not having any fights here, if you want to add some

13
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:00,530
text or something, you can, but I'm just going to get rid of all that.

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,620
We don't need it, OK?

15
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,760
And then let's do display flex.

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,080
And we don't need Collum just to put everything in the middle.

17
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,930
We're going to keep this.

18
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,390
And then we have the container, which actually gave it a class.

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:17,930
Let's.

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:27,530
Let's give it an I.D. as well, so I.D. container, because I'm going to use that for the JavaScript

21
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:38,880
and then here, let's say class container and we want to display flex actually before we do the container.

22
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,130
Let's do the squares.

23
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:50,300
So I'm just going to comment that out for a second and then let's add our square class and set a background

24
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,210
color and background color.

25
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:59,900
I'm going to set this to hexadecimal one D three times.

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,080
So let's see.

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,190
We can't see anything just yet.

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:16,100
Let's add a box shadow of zero zero for the offsets to pixel blur and black.

29
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,760
OK, and then for us to be able to see the squares, we have to add height and the width.

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,230
So let's give these a height and the width of 16 pixels.

31
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:39,240
So we'll do height, width of 16.

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,450
Good.

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,940
So now we can at least see the squares.

34
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,240
I'm going to just add a margin of two pixels as well.

35
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,570
Just pull them apart a little bit and we're going to want to transition.

36
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,050
So ultimately we're going to paint these on the screen and then we're going to make it so that when

37
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:02,110
we enter it turns a certain color, a random color, and when we leave it, it gets rid of that color.

38
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:05,930
And we want that to happen at kind of with a little fade effect.

39
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:16,290
So I'm going to add a transition here for, let's say, two seconds ease and let's also set for the

40
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,490
square cover.

41
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:28,590
So when we hover over it, I'm going to set the transition duration to zero seconds so that we have

42
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,520
an effect where when we hover over it, it immediately lights up.

43
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,630
And then when we come off of it, it will basically take two seconds for the color to disappear.

44
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,310
So it'll have that fade effect.

45
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,320
OK, we're not going to see that just yet, but we'll we'll get to that.

46
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,920
So the container see, we want to display Flex.

47
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,860
As soon as I do that, it's going to display in a row.

48
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,120
And I just want to set a line items to center and justify content to center.

49
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,360
And I want these to wrap.

50
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:11,180
So we'll set flex wrap to wrap.

51
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,400
We're not going to see a difference now because we don't have that many boxes, but we want to give

52
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,930
this a max width of 400 pixels.

53
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,610
OK, so if it goes beyond that, then it should wrap onto the next line.

54
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:33,250
So just to test that out, let's take these and let's create a bunch of them and save.

55
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:39,120
And now you can see when it gets past that 400 pixels or whatever, it will wrap onto the next line.

56
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,460
OK, so that looks good.

57
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,240
I think that's all we need to do for the season.

58
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:52,860
So let's clear out all of these squares, because like I said, we're going to paint them with the JavaScript

59
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,980
depending on, you know, what we set for the amount of squares.

60
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:59,070
And that's all we need is just this one container.

61
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,480
So in the next video, we'll jump into our JavaScript and we'll get started on that.
