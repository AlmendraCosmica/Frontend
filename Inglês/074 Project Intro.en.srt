1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,550
All right, guys, this is going to be a pretty quick project.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:05,060
It should only be one video.

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:11,250
We're going to create this kinetic loader where we have these two triangles created with proccess and

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,690
we're going to add this animation so that they rotate and one follows another.

5
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:16,350
All right.

6
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:22,440
So we're going to look at creating keyframes and also how to create these triangles using borders.

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,070
All right.

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,240
Let's go ahead and get into it.
