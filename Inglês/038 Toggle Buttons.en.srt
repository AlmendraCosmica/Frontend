1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,900
All right, so now we want to style these buttons, these icon buttons, position them.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,380
We want to give functionality to them so we can expand and contract these fake cues.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,740
So we have a class of fake cue dash toggle on the button.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,530
And obviously, we don't want to show the Chevron if it's expanded and we don't want to show the X if

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,230
it's if it's not expanded.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,010
So we're going to have to deal with that.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,920
But let's just do some basic stuff here first.

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,170
Like the background color I'm going to set to transparent and take away the border set.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,130
That's zero.

10
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,760
And let's set the cursor to appointer.

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:48,810
Let's set I'm actually going to display Flex here and then align and justify to the center so a line

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:56,850
items center and justify content center and then let's increase the font size.

13
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:05,660
So we'll increase that, say, 16 pixels and then we're going to set padding to zero.

14
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,960
Let's set the position to be absolutes.

15
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,610
And then as far as where we want to put these, the initial toggle is going to be top 30 pixels, 30

16
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,680
pixels from the top is going to be on the right.

17
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,870
So let's do 30 pixels from the right.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,040
And then the height will be 30 pixels and the width will be 30 pixels.

19
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,420
So if I save that.

20
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,200
Now, you can see these buttons over here as far as this first one.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,820
I forgot to put the class on that, so that's reclass FNQ Dasch, Tawakkol.

22
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:55,850
All right, so I'm going to set the X right here, the Times to display none so far.

23
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,110
You dash toggle, which is the button, and then not done.

24
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,090
This should be dash so fake you dash toggle and then the class of F.A.A. dash times, which is the X

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,060
icon, I'm going to set that to display none.

26
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,950
So now we only see the Chevron.

27
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,190
Now if it's active, we do want to see the times.

28
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,980
So let's just copy this.

29
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,340
And here we're going to say let's put active in front.

30
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:38,720
So F a Q fake, Q dot active and then times and then let's display block.

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,160
So now you can see that this is the X is showing on the active.

32
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,800
Now we want to remove the Chevron if it's active.

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:03:00,790
So let's take this and let's set Hefe active so toggle and then we want Chevron dash down and we want

34
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,080
to display none there.

35
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,610
So now we only see the Chevron if it's not active.

36
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,990
We see the if it is.

37
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,850
Another thing I want to do is get rid of the C this outline here.

38
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:19,900
So that's going to be on F.A.A. Q Dash toggle, which is the button we want to say in its focus state.

39
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,580
We want the outlined property to be set to zero.

40
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,170
OK, that'll get rid of that.

41
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:33,100
Also on the active toggle, let's grab this here.

42
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,060
So on the act of Torgau, I'm going to set a background color

43
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,840
of hexadecimal value, nine F a.

44
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,540
Four A.

45
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:58,240
So you can see the ex has that that background, I want that to be rounded or circular.

46
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,230
So I'm going to add on the FAA toggle a border radius of 50 percent.

47
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:07,780
And then I also want to make the text.

48
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,090
Are the icon white?

49
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,810
If it's if it's the times.

50
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,030
So right here, let's say color white.

51
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,690
All right.

52
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,160
So now we want to make this function.

53
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,490
But what I'd like you to do is pause the video and try this yourself.

54
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,940
If you don't need any hints at all, then go ahead and pause it now and try it if you want some hints.

55
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,760
I'm going to just paste this in for a second.

56
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,050
So you want to bring in your toggle buttons.

57
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,390
Remember, they have a class of fake you dash toggle and you want to use query selector all because

58
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,290
it's more than one.

59
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,850
So that will create a node list.

60
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,480
You want to loop through that no list using for each and then on each toggle you want to add an event

61
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,210
listener, a click event listener because we're clicking on them.

62
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:55,930
And then you want to toggle the active class on the parent node.

63
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:59,590
You don't want to add the active class to this to toggle.

64
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:06,940
You want to add it on the parent, which is this div here, OK, and you can use dot parent node to

65
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:13,060
access that and then to toggle a specific class, you can do class list toggle and passata.

66
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:17,350
And so this should give you enough information to to really know how to do this.

67
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,520
So if you want to pause it and go ahead and try it, do that and then come back.

68
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,730
So I'm going to bring in my toggles.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:33,580
So I'll set toggles to document DOT and we want to use query selector all and they have a class of F

70
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:41,590
a Q dash toggle and then I'm going to take that node list and I'm going to loop through with four each.

71
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,960
So say for each toggle.

72
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:51,240
I want to take that specific toggle and add an event listener onto it.

73
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,100
I want to listen for a click event.

74
00:05:54,670 --> 00:06:01,210
And when that happens, I'm going to run a function and take the toggle, which is the button, and

75
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:09,070
I want to access the parent nodes so we can say dot parent node and I want to access the class list

76
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,670
and then call the not remove.

77
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:17,500
We want to call the toggle method and we want to toggle the act of class and that's it.

78
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,880
So very, very simple.

79
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:24,330
If we go over here and I click on that, it's going to take away the active class.

80
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,530
If I click it again, it's going to put it back so I can toggle that this and I can open the mall if

81
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:29,920
I want.

82
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:35,320
It doesn't have to be, you know, one by one or whatever can open as many as we want.

83
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,590
OK, and that's it.

84
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,290
And this is something that back when I was learning how to do this stuff, you would use Jacoway for

85
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:48,760
most likely because JavaScript just wasn't where it is today.

86
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:51,040
Query selector all didn't even exist.

87
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,740
It was just it was it was a lot of extra code just to do something simple.

88
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,510
So I mean, if you're learning JavaScript now, it's, it's much better than it was back in the day

89
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:07,240
when you had to use Jacoway for the smallest little just activity in the DOM.

90
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,350
But that's it.

91
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,640
Hopefully guys enjoyed this.

92
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,140
I will see you in the next project.
