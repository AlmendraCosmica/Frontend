00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,160
All right, so this is one of the cooler looking projects we're going to build this theme clock where

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,000
we use access to style, these hands right here, these needles, which are obviously the hour, the

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,710
minute and second, and then we're going to use JavaScript to power it and have it show the current

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:17,340
time.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,760
We're going to update it every second so that it takes like an actual clock.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,590
We're going to show a digital readout of the time, the day, the date, and we're also going to be

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,220
able to toggle it to dark mode and then back to light mode.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,880
So this is one of my favorite projects of this course.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:33,900
So let's go ahead and jump in.
