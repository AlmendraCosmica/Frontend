00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,840
All right, so in this project, we're going to create an increment counter and I'm sure you've seen

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,000
this on websites somewhere.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:07,830
Basically, we have these numbers.

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,260
I'm just using Twitter, YouTube, Facebook fans.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:11,960
But this could be any number.

6
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:18,690
And when we come to the site, initially, you can see that it counts from zero up and we can set the

7
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:24,310
whatever the increment is, we can set that to whatever we'd like to make it faster or slower.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,220
So we're going to first just create created style it we're going to make it responsive.

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:35,460
So when it's on a small screen, you know, it goes vertical and then we'll add the JavaScript to make

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,750
it increment like this.

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,250
All right.

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,150
So let's get started.
