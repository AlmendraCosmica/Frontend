1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,080
All right, so we're going to start in our JavaScript.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,950
Now we're going to add the just the DOM functionality for now so we can add it to do and enter and it'll

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,000
get added here.

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,850
We'll be able to market as complete and remove it, but we'll do the local storage stuff in the video

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:15,710
after this one.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,580
So let's go ahead and first bring in what we need.

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:27,030
So we want our form document get element by D form has an idea of form and then we also want our input

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:29,940
so we can get the value.

9
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,850
And that has an idea of input.

10
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:43,750
And we also want the to dos ul so say to dos you l and that has an idea of to dos.

11
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,790
All right.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,030
Now on the form we're going to add an event listener.

13
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,630
We want to listen for a submit of the form.

14
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:58,530
When that happens, we'll have a function, takes an event, object as an argument, and then we can

15
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,840
take that event object and call prevent default to prevent the form from having its default behaviour.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,340
Then we're going to call a function called ADD to do.

17
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,260
All right.

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,600
So for this function, say add to do and it's going to have the option to take in a to do.

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,800
And what we'll do is initialize a variable called to do text and set that to whatever the input value

20
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,160
is.

21
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:41,970
Now if a to do is passed in here, then we want to set to do text two to do and then dot text.

22
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:48,510
OK, if, if it's Pastan initially, if we're just submitting to do here, it's not going to get passed

23
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:51,330
and so it'll be whatever the value is.

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,120
All right.

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,940
In fact, we can just console log and see to do text is type something in hit enter and you can see

26
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,830
it's getting logged.

27
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:01,810
All right.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,210
Now, next thing is to construct a list item.

29
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:12,930
So we just want to make sure that to do text exists.

30
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:23,730
So if to do text, then let's create a to do element and we'll set this to document create element and

31
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:34,170
we're going to create a list item and then we want to check to see, let's say, if to do and to do

32
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,450
dot completed.

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,260
Then we're going to add the class of completed.

34
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:48,840
So to do elements dot class list dot and we're going to add the class of completed.

35
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,070
All right.

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,680
Outside of that let's take the to do element and let's set the entire text.

37
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,210
So the list item in a text is going to get set to whatever to do.

38
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,160
Text is all right, so save that.

39
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,550
Now, if I do this, nothing is going to happen just yet.

40
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,030
Let's go ahead and add that to the DOM.

41
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:20,070
So we'll take the to dos you l so to dos you ul and we want to append a child element and what we want

42
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,540
to append is the to do element, which is the list item.

43
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,400
And I just want to clear the form.

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,790
So we'll take the input and we'll set the value equal to nothing.

45
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,510
So now if I say to do one enter.

46
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,710
To do.

47
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,880
To enter.

48
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,580
They're going to get at it now.

49
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:43,400
Nothing happens if I click or right click or or anything.

50
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,890
If I reload, they're going to go away.

51
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,300
So the keeping them there in local storage will do that in the next video.

52
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:59,840
But I do want to be able to at least delete them and and also mark them as completed.

53
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:09,410
So let's go right above where we added it to the dorm and let's take the specific to do element and

54
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,850
add an event listener to it.

55
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,980
So say add event listener and we want to listen for a click.

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,870
And when that happens, we'll have a function and just one line.

57
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,310
So we don't need curly braces.

58
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:31,670
We'll just take the to do element and we want to take the class list and call actually not add.

59
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:34,280
We want to toggle because we want to be able to toggle completed.

60
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,770
So toggle the class of completed.

61
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:38,840
All right.

62
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,760
Now if I save that this is they're going to go away when I save just because the page reloads.

63
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,010
But let's just say to do one.

64
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,960
And now if I click on it, you can see that the class of completed is applied.

65
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,030
If I click again, it's taken away.

66
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,740
So it's going to toggle that class.

67
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:56,090
All right.

68
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,660
Now to remove we want to do a right click.

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,380
So I'm going to add another event listener.

70
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:09,440
I'm going to just grab this and instead of click, we're going to listen for context menu.

71
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
So that's going to be a right click.

72
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,130
So when that happens, we want to prevent the default behavior.

73
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:25,040
So I'm going to say we want this to be to go to some curly braces that and we want to also pass in,

74
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,830
because right now, if you right.

75
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,150
Click, it's going to bring that up.

76
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,900
We don't want that.

77
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,460
We want to prevent that from happening.

78
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,650
So let's idot prevent default.

79
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:40,340
So if I were to put something in here and now I'm right clicking I'm not seeing the, you know, the

80
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,560
default, the native context menu.

81
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:49,220
What I want to do though is take that to do element and remove it completely from the DOM.

82
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,520
So we just call removes.

83
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,260
Now if I put something in here and I right.

84
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,790
Click That goes away.

85
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,780
That goes away.

86
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,770
That goes away.

87
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,720
OK, so that's pretty much it as far as the functionality for the DOM.

88
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:08,270
So in the next video we're going to apply local storage so that every time we reload or come back to

89
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,890
the page, they're not gone.
