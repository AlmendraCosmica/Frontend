1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:03,030
All right, so now we have the fun part, which is the JavaScript.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:05,010
So let's jump in to skip James.

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:10,050
And first thing we want to do is grab the container, which is the only element that we have in the

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:10,790
in the body.

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,250
So let's say document dot, get element bidi in that has an I.D. of container.

6
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:26,760
Now we want to create an array of colors here because we want to we want these to be random colors when

7
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,340
we follow along the squares.

8
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,740
So I'm going to just paste in some hexadecimal values.

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,050
You can use absolutely any colors you want.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,300
They can be hexadecimal, they can be RGB, they can be color names, whatever you want.

11
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,910
And then we want a variable here.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,840
I'm going to give this just all caps here.

13
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,220
Call the squares and then the amount of squares that we want to put on the screen, which is going to

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,780
be 500 in this case.

15
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,480
I don't know why I put a semicolon.

16
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,760
I don't use semicolons.

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,410
So those are the variables we need.

18
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,830
And then the way we're going to do this is create a for loop.

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,320
OK, so we want to say for and let's let AI equals zero.

20
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:09,030
So it's going to start at zero.

21
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:17,100
And then as long as I is less than whatever we have in squares and then we want to increment I by one.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,500
So in here we're going to create an element.

23
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:31,620
So let's say conse square and on the document object there's a method called Spell This Right document.

24
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:38,520
There's a method called create element and we can create any type of the DOM element that we want.

25
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:42,150
I'm going to create a div and then I want to add the class of square.

26
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:50,520
So I'm going to take the square element and I'm going to say class list dot add and I want to add the

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:59,130
class of square because that's, you know, the square we restyled this, this square class and that's

28
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,230
what we want to show.

29
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,050
Now this isn't going to do anything just yet.

30
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,640
We want to take the container that we brought in and we want to append child because we want to insert

31
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,280
this into the container and we'll pass in here square like that.

32
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,160
OK, now, if we save this, you can see that 500 squares have now been painted.

33
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,630
If I change this to two hundred and I save now, we have two hundred.

34
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,160
So you can change this to whatever you want, but we're going to go ahead and paint 500 squares.

35
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:36,570
And then what we want to happen is when we hover over these, we want to basically have them light up

36
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,400
with a random color.

37
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:46,020
So inside this for loop, let's take the square and I want to add an event listener.

38
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:53,400
So I'm going to say add event listener and pass in the event in this case is going to be mouseover.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,690
So when we just hover over a square, this is going to fire off.

40
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,860
And I want this to call a function that we're going to create that says that's called set color and

41
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,010
we want to pass in that particular square.

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,330
All right.

43
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,430
We want to do the same thing when we leave.

44
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,940
So we'll have an event listener on mouse out.

45
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,860
So when we leave a square and then we'll call remove color, OK?

46
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,040
And then let's go down here and let's create function sets, color and say element.

47
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:35,670
And just for now, let's console log here element.

48
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:41,520
So if I save that and I open up my console to remove color is not defined.

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,180
So I just need to define remove color elements.

50
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:50,740
All right.

51
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:56,850
So now if I hover over a square, you can see it's just going to or I shouldn't say hover, but if I

52
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,550
mouse over, it's going to call that.

53
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,410
All right.

54
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,900
If I come out of it, it's going to call remove color.

55
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,810
So that's why I just do like console log one, two, three.

56
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:12,330
And we go over here, you'll see that each time I get out of a of a square, it's going to fire this

57
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:12,690
off.

58
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,490
All right.

59
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,730
So let's get rid of that and let's do the set color first.

60
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:20,070
So we need to have a specific color.

61
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:25,260
I'm going to have a function called Get Random Color, because we don't want it to always be the same

62
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,620
one.

63
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:34,890
So down here, let's say function, get random color and we want to return.

64
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:42,150
And remember, we have that colors array and we can access like the zero index is going to give us this

65
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,540
one then one, two, three, four.

66
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,460
So I want to get a random index.

67
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:53,220
So inside here, instead of hard coding a number, I'm going to say math dot floor because I want to

68
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,550
round down and then math dot random.

69
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,860
So math random gives me a random decimal I.

70
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,540
We want to multiply that by the length of the array, so colors, length, that way it's going to be

71
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,560
somewhere in between zero and what, four?

72
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,190
So zero.

73
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,720
One, two, three, four.

74
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,430
OK.

75
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:21,030
In fact, I can go ahead and console log here the color.

76
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,590
And if I go over and hover, you'll see that it's going to be one of those colors.

77
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,210
Good.

78
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,600
So now we just need to set it to the actual square.

79
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,380
In this case, the element because the square is getting passed in is the element.

80
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:44,040
So we can set the style, let's set the style dot background and we're going to set that equal to whatever

81
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,030
the color is.

82
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:55,580
And then also the box Shadowlord set element, perhaps element, dot style, dot box, shadow.

83
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:00,720
You want to use Camil case for this and we're going to set that to show you some back ticks here.

84
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,310
And it's going to be zero zero two pixels and then whatever the color is.

85
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:16,260
So in here we'll pass and the color and then another shadow so comma zero zero 10 pixels and then whatever

86
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,780
the color is.

87
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,170
All right.

88
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,200
So I save that.

89
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,810
Let's close the console up and go over here.

90
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:26,090
And you can see wherever I go, it's going to give me a random color.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,240
So you could you could create like a drawing app with this.

92
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,540
You can make them smaller and you could add some other functionality to it.

93
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,460
I just want I just want them to disappear once we come off it, because right now we can fill the whole

94
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:41,900
thing.

95
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:45,210
I mean, if that's what you want to do, that's fine.

96
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:46,600
But I want to remove the color.

97
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,980
So what we'll do is one that remove is called we'll take the element and set the style dot background.

98
00:06:52,980 --> 00:07:00,690
And we want to set it back to the original the original color of the box, which is this right here.

99
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:08,370
OK, so we're going to set that equal to that color on remove and then set the box shadow.

100
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:13,440
So element dot style, dot box shadow.

101
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:19,550
We're going to set that to the original box shadow, which is this right here.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,250
So pass that in here.

103
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:25,070
All right.

104
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,040
So let's save that.

105
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:34,440
And now you can see I can go over and get a random color, but it disappears and it fades out like that.

106
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:40,260
It takes two seconds to fade out because of this transition right here.

107
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,770
OK, so if I if I take this transition off, then it's just going to do this.

108
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,570
And that is kind of stupid.

109
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:53,610
So we want to leave that trail by doing that, adding that transition.

110
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:00,030
And just like with any other project in this course, I encourage you to add to it, maybe have some

111
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,260
select a select box where you can choose different color schemes or something like that.

112
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm sure that you can think of something.

113
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:13,020
This is just a good template to create some kind of drawing application or something like that.

114
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,710
All right.

115
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,520
So that's it.

116
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,350
Let's move on to the next project.
