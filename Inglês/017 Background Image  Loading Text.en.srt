1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,010
So we're going to get started on the blurry loading project and the trial is going to be really simple,

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,710
is actually only two lines in the body.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,140
Well, let's add a title here.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:17,850
So call this blurry floating and then down here, let's get rid of the H1.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,900
And this is going to be a section I'm going to give this a class of B.G. So this is going to be the

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,030
background image that we blur and then we'll have around.

7
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:34,710
The text will have a class of loading dash text and we just want to put in here zero percent and that

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,220
should do it as far as the as far as the HTML goes.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,240
So let's jump in to our stylesheet and there's not too much we have to do here either.

10
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,810
I'm going to change the font.

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:54,450
So I just want this to be Google APIs dot com exists and we want to use a font family.

12
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,110
I'm going to use a family of Ubuntu.

13
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:12,770
I can smell family correctly and then let's change down here, change for to Bunta and then this stuff

14
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,390
can really all stay the same.

15
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,240
You don't have to change anything here.

16
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,900
We don't need Fleck's direction column, but it's not going to hurt if you do leave it.

17
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:28,400
Now for the background level, we have that section with the class of B.G. and we want to set a background.

18
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:33,770
So let's just use the background property and say we want this to be a neutral.

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,440
And the actual image that I'm going to use, I'm just going to copy and paste.

20
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,540
And of course, you can use any image you want.

21
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,560
If you want to use this one, you can get it from the link from the repository.

22
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,300
So let's make this have no repeat.

23
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:54,080
Let's make it center center on the X and Y axis and cover for the background position.

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,650
And we want to position this absolute.

25
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:10,060
And then let's set the top, so I'm going to initially just set the top and left to zero.

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,010
I'm going to change this and I'll show you why in a couple of minutes.

27
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:25,010
And then the width will set that to 100 viewport widths and the height to 100 viewport height.

28
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,060
So we just wanted to take up the whole viewport.

29
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:34,200
And let's add a Z index here of negative one, because we want this to be behind the zero percent or

30
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,120
whatever the percentages, the text.

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,810
And we want to add a filter here.

32
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,040
And initially the blur is going to be set to zero pixels.

33
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,960
And then for the loading text, we just want to increase the font size.

34
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:59,370
Let's set that set the font size to 50 pixels and let's set the color to white.

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,370
Really depends on the background image we use.

36
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,350
All right.

37
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,350
So that gives us this.

38
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,090
Now, I just want to show you something, Afie, because this is going to start blurry and then it's

39
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:12,720
going to make its way up or make its way down, I should say.

40
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,500
The higher the pixels for the blur, the more blurry it is.

41
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,740
So if I put like 70 pixels in here, that's what it looks like now.

42
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,860
Notice on the edges, this comes out quite a bit.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,380
So I actually want to fix that.

44
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,590
I don't want it to come out that much.

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,550
So for the top and left, I'm going to set that to negative 30 pixels.

46
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,720
And it's also set the left to negative 30 pixels.

47
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:42,450
Now, if I do that, you're going to see there's less spacing on the left in the top, but there's more

48
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,150
over here.

49
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,340
So for the width and the height, what we can do is calculate so we can use calc and just wrap this

50
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,130
and we just want to add 60 pixels like that.

51
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,310
And now you can see that it's even on the left and right.

52
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,160
We want to do the same for the top and bottom.

53
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,310
So we'll do the same thing.

54
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:08,670
We'll just calc and we want to add 60 pixels here as well.

55
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,880
And now there's not as much space.

56
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:12,970
All right.

57
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,880
So I think that that looks a little better.

58
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,780
So let's put this back to zero pixels.

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:25,110
So in the next video, we want to add our JavaScript so that we can have this image basically start

60
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,530
blurry and then have it work its way up to being clear as this percentage loads here.
