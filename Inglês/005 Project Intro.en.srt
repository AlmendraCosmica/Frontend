00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,020
All right, so in this project, we're going to build some expanding cards, basically we were going

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:08,220
to style these panels to have a background image and a heading.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,230
We're going to use flex blocks to align everything and then add a little bit of JavaScript so that when

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:20,550
we click one of these, it changes the class to active and it then expands with the CSFs transition

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:20,900
case.

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,920
We'll be using JavaScript for the event.

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:28,530
Listeners will be using CSS transitions to give it the smooth through the fact you'll see the heading

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,160
doesn't come in until the card is fully expanded as well.

9
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,830
And we're using just background images and headings.

10
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,950
But you could make these into testimonials or fake hues or whatever it might be.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,590
So hopefully you enjoy it.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,580
Let's go ahead and jump in and get started.
