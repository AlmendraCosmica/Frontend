Hey, guys, in this project, we're going to be creating a split landing page and I did something similar

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:11,280
to this on my YouTube channel a while ago, and we're going to actually format it to be PlayStation

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,220
five and Xbox series.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,860
So maybe you have a store and you know, these these are just released.

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,500
I can't even get my hands on a PlayStation five right now.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,120
But, you know, we might have a store where you can come and you can choose one of these.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:29,760
And we're going to create this split screen with a background image, with an overlay, with some content

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,450
inside.

9
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:35,090
And if we click on one side, it's going to stretch out to 75 percent.

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,080
The other side, 25 percent.

11
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,020
If I hover on the right side, it's going to do the same thing.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,680
All right.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,650
We'll add a little hover effect onto these.

14
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,120
So I think it's just a nice looking little landing page.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,770
So that's what we building.

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,480
It's going to be very CSFs heavy.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,330
We'll do a little bit of JavaScript at the end for the hover effects, but lots of success in this project.

18
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,320
So let's jump in.
