1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,490
All right, so in this video, we're going to do the human access for the expanding cards and then we'll

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,590
get into the JavaScript in the next video.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,390
So we have projects that are open, have my index HTML.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:21,720
I'm going to go ahead and change the title here to expanding cards and then let's get rid of this H1

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,140
here.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,780
And this is going to be pretty simple.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:31,500
We're just going to have a container wrapped around five divs with the class of panel now for this first

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,840
one and we'll have a class of panel and also a class of active, because that's how we're going to tell

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,760
which card is going to be expanded.

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,490
It's going to have a class of active and inside the div is just going to be whatever the H three as

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,890
this one is going to be, explore the world.

12
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:48,540
Of course, you can change that if you want.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,800
And then we're going to have an inline style for the background image.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,130
So you could easily, you know, change that if you want.

15
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:06,000
So let's say background image and set that to a euro and single quotes in here with a link to an image

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,010
which you could use whatever you want.

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:15,140
I'm going to just grab a link to an unspoilt image and paste that in between the quotes here.

18
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:22,020
OK, so if I save that, I'm just going to see just the content, which is the H3 with the background

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,500
image behind it, but it's only going to take up as much as the content does for now.

20
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,130
So for the other four panel devs, I'm going to go right under this, still within the container and

21
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,590
I'm just going to post season.

22
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,680
And of course, you can grab these from the project repository.

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:46,290
And again, they're just panels with a background image in the inline style and then an H3 in the div.

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,000
So wild forests and a beach city on Winter Mountains clouds.

25
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,770
So we'll save and now we can see all the H 3s will a little bit of the background image.

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,920
So now let's jump into the stylesheet and start to make this look, you know, like some cards that

27
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,880
we can expand.

28
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:13,830
So the font I'm going to take this out and say CSFs, questionmark family and set that to Ally.

29
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:17,760
And then let's add that here in the body.

30
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,290
So that will change the font.

31
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,520
We don't need Flex Direct Direction column and then this the rest of this can stay the same for the

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,030
body.

33
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:36,360
Now, remember, we have a container wrapped around all the panels, and all I want to do here is display

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,040
this as a flex box.

35
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,010
So immediately it's going to turn it into a flex row.

36
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,090
OK, so our container right here is now a flex box.

37
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:51,030
So any immediate children, which are all these devices, are going to be put horizontal into a row.

38
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:56,670
If we wanted them on top of each other, we could do flex direction column like that.

39
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,180
But we don't.

40
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,430
We want them in a row now.

41
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,100
It takes up one hundred, you know, 100 viewport widths right now or 100 percent of the viewport.

42
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:12,270
So I'm going to set the width of the container to 90 VW, which is a viewport width.

43
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:17,920
So if you think of the width as 100 slices going this way, we're taking up 90 of the 100.

44
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,840
So the next thing I want to do is the panels.

45
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,390
So that's all we need for the container.

46
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,510
So for the panel class, it already has the background image.

47
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,670
But let's add some other background attributes like the size.

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,320
Right now, you can only see a small portion of the image.

49
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,050
I'm going to set this to auto and 100 percent.

50
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:42,780
And now you can see, you know, much more of the image.

51
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:44,970
I'm going to set the position.

52
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,470
So background position all set to center.

53
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,330
And I don't want any repeat.

54
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,790
So let's set the background dash repeat to no repeat.

55
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:04,780
OK, and then for the height of these, let's make them not not quite the whole height of the viewport.

56
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,950
Let's do 80 votes.

57
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,630
So 80 viewport heights, OK?

58
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,930
It's starting to look a little better.

59
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,570
Let's set the border or I'm not the border, but the border radius.

60
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,210
I'm going to set that to 50 pixels.

61
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:21,780
So make them rounded and you can style it differently if you like.

62
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,500
I'm going to set the color of the text inside to be white.

63
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:30,600
I want a cursor pointer so that when I hover over it, we have a cursor.

64
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,500
Now the width we can set the flex prop..

65
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,150
Since we're using flex box, I'm going to set it to an initial value of zero point five.

66
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:41,010
So they're all going to be even right now.

67
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,170
But when we have the active class, what we'll do is we'll change this to something much higher, like

68
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:56,820
Flex five, OK, and let's separate these out a bit so we'll add a margin of ten pixels and then let's

69
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,730
make this position relative.

70
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:07,120
Because I want to position the H threes and side absolute, so that means that the the H3 container

71
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,900
Divx, which is our container element, which is the panel has to be relative.

72
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:18,220
And then when we do change the width for the active, like when we click and it turns active, I want

73
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,070
it to not just flick to a bigger size or bigger width, but I wanted to have a transition.

74
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:30,130
So let's say let's add a transition on the flex property and we'll make it zero point seven seconds

75
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,920
for the duration with an ease in effect.

76
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,500
OK, so we'll save that.

77
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:42,190
Now, before we get to the active class, let's do the H threes that are inside of the panels.

78
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:52,480
So we have panel H three and I'm going to set the font size to twenty four pixels and let's set the

79
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,320
position.

80
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,290
So position is going to be absolute.

81
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,720
That's why I made this relative.

82
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,150
We want the H3 absolute within it and I want it to be at the bottom left corner.

83
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,870
So let's say 20 pixels from the bottom and 20 pixels from the left.

84
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,710
I save that.

85
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:10,540
You can see the position has changed.

86
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,470
I'm going to set margin to zero on these.

87
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,970
And I also only want the tree to show if it's on if it's active.

88
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:19,270
Right.

89
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,410
Because this doesn't look good.

90
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,300
We can't even read the headings.

91
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,700
So let's set the capacity to zero, which will just make them invisible.

92
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,040
OK, but will when it's active, we'll show them.

93
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:35,730
So let's first do the panel if it's active.

94
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:43,750
So we're just saying if the panel div also has an active class, will change the flux from zero point

95
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,330
five, which is the initial value to five.

96
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:56,470
And now you can see it's much wider for the H3, let's say panel active age three and it has an opacity

97
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,780
of zero right now for every panel.

98
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,260
But if it's active, let's set the opacity to one.

99
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,110
That way we can see it if it's active.

100
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:15,580
OK, now I do want to make it so if the screen is really small that we only show three instead of five

101
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,540
of these cards.

102
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:25,120
So to do that, we can add a media query by saying at media and we can use a min or a max with, I'm

103
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,360
going to say max width of four eighty pixels.

104
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:34,150
And what this means is any styles that I put in here are only going to take effect if the screen is

105
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,740
under forty eighty pixels.

106
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:41,800
So one thing I want to do is the container is initially set to a width of I think it's 90 viewport widths.

107
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:47,200
We're going to set it to 100 viewport widths on small screens so that it takes up a little more room

108
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,820
and it gives us some extra space.

109
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:52,750
OK, and then I'm going to remove the last two panels.

110
00:07:53,170 --> 00:08:00,520
And the way that I can do that is by saying, panel and I can use the pseudo selector by using a colon

111
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,150
here and then a dash of dash type.

112
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,330
And I want the last two.

113
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,680
So there's five total.

114
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,720
I want four and five so I can take enth of type four.

115
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,100
That's going to grab this one.

116
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:17,020
But I also want the fifth one.

117
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,970
So I'm just going to copy that.

118
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:25,420
Put a comma here and let's also grab the fifth one last one and let's set display to none, which will

119
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,490
just get rid of them.

120
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:31,450
So now you can see on small screens there's only three images or three cards.

121
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,910
If I go past four eighty now there's five.

122
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:37,330
OK, so that's what that media query does for us.

123
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,950
I'm just going to make this a little bigger.

124
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,640
So that should do it for the success.

125
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:48,950
Now, obviously, we want the functionality where we click on one of these and it expands and, you

126
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,290
know, the other one gets smaller and we can see whichever one is active.

127
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,720
So for that, we need JavaScript.

128
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,380
So that's what we're going to do in the next video.
