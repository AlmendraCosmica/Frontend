1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,990
All right, so we're going to start on our sticky nav, and the way I'm going to do this is we'll do

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,600
all the e-mail now and then we're going to style the whole rest of the page, including the hero image,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,150
the hero area with the overlay, and then in the next video will style the navigation and add a little

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,180
bit of JavaScript that we need in order to give it that effect where it's it's making it active and

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,880
not active, depending where we're scrolling on the page.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:24,510
All right.

7
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,600
So let's start off in our HTML here.

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,930
We'll just say sticky navigation for the title.

9
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,970
And down here, first thing we're going to have here is the navigation.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,530
So I'm going to use an HTML5 nav tag and I'm just going to give a class of NAV as well.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:46,950
And inside there, we want a container class because we don't want all we don't want the logo on this

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:53,490
side and the links on this side to stick to the edges if the browser is too long or too wide.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,390
So we'll settle with a max width of like twelve hundred on the container.

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:00:59,850
And then inside here we want two things.

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,500
One is going to be the one.

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,440
I'm just going to give that a class of logo.

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,730
Usually you'll have a link around the logo.

18
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:09,840
Just go to the, you know, this page here and inside here.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,290
I'll just say my Web site, OK, and then under the one we want to have our unordered list with our

20
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,000
list items and our links.

21
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,360
And these aren't actually going to go anywhere.

22
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,510
Let's say home will have for these.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,890
So we'll do home about services.

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,690
These are kind of the default pages that we use.

25
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,480
And then I'm going to add a class of active onto home.

26
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,640
So basically we just want a different color link for whatever page you're on.

27
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:46,890
So if I save that, it's going to look really weird just because of the default styles we have, putting

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,350
everything in the middle and so on.

29
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:54,950
So let's move on under the nav now and we're going to have our hero area.

30
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,580
So let's have a class of hero.

31
00:01:56,910 --> 00:02:02,430
And we also want the container in here because we want to contain the content and let's do an H1.

32
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:10,830
We'll say welcome to my Web site and then a paragraph and we'll just do Lorem 10 enter to give us ten

33
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,230
words of text.

34
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,350
All right.

35
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:20,340
Now, under the hero will have a section and the section is going to also use the container class and

36
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,180
also give it a class of content and we'll do an H.

37
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,170
Let's do an H2 here and say content one paragraph.

38
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,970
We'll do Lorem one hundred.

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:42,430
And then under the that paragraph will do, say, an H3 will say contents to obviously this would be

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,400
whatever you want on your site.

41
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:45,970
So we just need something.

42
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,370
So a couple of paragraphs and headings.

43
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:48,670
Good.

44
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,090
So now what I'm going to do is just comment out the now for now, because I want to style the rest of

45
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,600
the page.

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:59,530
That way we can do everything that we need to with the nav bar in the next video.

47
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:06,310
So in our stylesheet here, let's go ahead and change in the body.

48
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,950
We don't actually need flaks or anything like that.

49
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,250
So we're going to get rid of all of this, actually.

50
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:21,070
And then let's just set a color of two, two, two for the text and let's use open sans is a find.

51
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,200
It looks a little nicer.

52
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:34,060
So success questionmark family set that to open plus Sande's and we'll add that here open sans.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,510
And then I want to add a reset.

54
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:42,230
So we want to take the margin and padding off of everything that includes the body.

55
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:49,240
OK, so now there's no margin and padding and then in the body I'm going to add just padding bottom

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,840
of 50 pixels just to give some room at the bottom.

57
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,600
All right, now the container.

58
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:05,050
I'm going to set a max width of twelve hundred pixels and then for the margin, we want zero top and

59
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,560
bottom and then auto on the left and right, which will put it in the middle.

60
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,150
So now if I stretch this so you can see anywhere we use the container, it's going to end right here,

61
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,810
including the NAV, which I just have commented out right now.

62
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,100
All right.

63
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,460
We can make this a little smaller here and here.

64
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,210
All right.

65
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,120
Now, the NAV stuff will go here.

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,840
But let's just let's just put a to do here, so to do now.

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,360
All right.

68
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,930
Now I want to work on the hero area, which is this here.

69
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:43,810
I want this to take up the full screen right here, all the viewport heights with a background image,

70
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,870
with an overlay.

71
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:54,010
So let's take the class of hero and let's do a actually let's add let's add the background.

72
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,260
Image first, so the background image is going to be a neutral and I'm just going to grab it.

73
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:07,320
It's from the pixels dotcom Web site and of course, you could use any image you want here.

74
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,720
And if I say we're only going to see it up to the height of the content so we can't even, you know,

75
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,800
make out the image.

76
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,570
But let's add a height.

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,650
Actually, I'm going to make this a little wider.

78
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,960
So let's make the height of this, take up the whole viewport.

79
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,220
So one hundred viewport heights like that right now.

80
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,090
I do want to add some background properties because that doesn't look how I want.

81
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:41,760
So let's set first of all, we'll do background repeat, set that to no repeat, then we'll do background

82
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,420
size and we'll set that to cover.

83
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,550
OK, as soon as I do that, we can see the whole image and then I'm going to position it.

84
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:58,830
So background position, we're going to set that to the bottom center.

85
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,070
All right.

86
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,080
And then, yeah, that should do it for the background image.

87
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:12,870
OK, now the content inside, we want to deal with that, so let's go under the height here.

88
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:27,160
Let's set the color of this to white and let's display blacks so that we can justify content center

89
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,810
and also we want to align items center.

90
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,990
So it's going to put it right in the middle.

91
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,820
We also want to text a line to the center like that.

92
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,010
And let's add.

93
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:51,700
Let's see, let's add a position relative, because we're going to be adding an overlay inside of it,

94
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:57,490
which will be positioned absolute, I also want to just add some margin bottom to push the content below

95
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:57,970
it down.

96
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,450
So the 20 pixels, so that takes up one hundred viewport heights.

97
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:04,010
And then when we scroll, we can see the rest of the content.

98
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:11,110
Now for the overlay, we want to add an overlay because this this image is way too bright.

99
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,620
This is the contrast is not right here.

100
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:14,620
This is unreadable.

101
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,030
I mean, it's readable, but it's it's not readable enough.

102
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:24,790
So we could add an extra element in the HTML to add the overlay to.

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,600
But what we'll do is use the DB for pseudo selector.

104
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:37,300
So if we say hero, colon, colon before it, basically kind of you can think of it as adding like a

105
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,970
ghost element to style.

106
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:46,630
So before and when we use before or after, we have to add content and you can actually store something.

107
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,940
There you can add content like hello, which is right here, so that's getting inserted with the.

108
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,840
Now, we don't want to add any text, so we're going to leave that blank.

109
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,010
And then we want this to be just placed over this entire thing, over the hero.

110
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:09,750
So we'll position it absolute within the hero, which we positioned relative.

111
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:13,300
And then once we do that, we want to set the top.

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,100
So basically say we're going to start it at the top zero and left zero position and we want it to cover

113
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,090
the entire thing.

114
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:24,420
So the with hundred percent height, 100 percent.

115
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,300
All right.

116
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:32,580
And then we could add a background or as background color.

117
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,650
So background color.

118
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:42,960
Now if I say background, color red, you can see that it adds an entire overlay to that area because

119
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,250
we positioned it relative.

120
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,550
We started it at the top left corner and we had to go total with total height.

121
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,770
Now, obviously, we don't want a solid color like this.

122
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:58,320
So what we'll do is use our GBA red, green, blue, alpha, and we'll make it black and alpha.

123
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,750
The last value is the transparency or the opacity.

124
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,830
So let's set that to zero point six.

125
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,670
And now you can see we have this overlay.

126
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,020
If I make it higher, like zero point nine, if it's darker, if I do zero point two, it's lighter.

127
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,080
I think six is and I think that looks good.

128
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,620
Or maybe five.

129
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,790
Now, the problem here is that the text is actually behind the overlay.

130
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,070
So the text is darkened, which we don't want.

131
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:33,120
So I'm going to set a Z index, which is basically how close to you how close to the screen an element

132
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,450
is.

133
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,210
We're going to push this back.

134
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:45,330
So let's do negative two, which didn't work because I want to set that to negative one and set this

135
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,910
the hero to negative two.

136
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,810
So this is the index.

137
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,590
We'll set that to negative two.

138
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,750
And now you can see it goes the image, the overlay and then the text.

139
00:09:59,280 --> 00:09:59,700
All right.

140
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:05,190
Now I just want to kind of like make this each one a little bigger and position it better.

141
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:17,340
So let's do hero H1 and set the font size to forty six pixels and we're going to add the same margin.

142
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,870
So margin.

143
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,010
I want to move it up a bit.

144
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:28,020
So negative 20 pixels zero and then 20 pixels on the bottom and then for the paragraph.

145
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:38,490
So hero P let's make the font size twenty pixels and let's make the letter spacing.

146
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,090
Will do.

147
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,610
We'll do one pixel for that.

148
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:48,370
Pace that looks a little better, and then for the content, we need to separate some of this stuff

149
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:48,590
out.

150
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:58,060
So let's say content age two and we also have an H3 in there and let's say font size for this will do

151
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,370
we'll do a percentage.

152
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,190
So hundred and fifty percent for those.

153
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:09,250
And let's also do margin 10 pixels on the top and bottom.

154
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,560
Separate that out from the paragraph's.

155
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:19,360
And then for the paragraph's, let's say content P, let's say color five five five.

156
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,760
And the line height can see how the lines are very close together.

157
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:32,050
So we'll do a line height of 30 pixels and let's do letter spacing of one point five pixels.

158
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:39,580
So if we take a look at that actuals to one point, that's kind of it's kind of much.

159
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,590
Let's do one point two for that.

160
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,330
All right, and actually, let's do 20 pixels on the headings.

161
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:51,820
All right, so that's good.

162
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,880
Now for the Navar and let me just show you if I make this bigger.

163
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:05,740
OK, so that sort of looks like so not much, but it's the start of, you know, 90 percent of the websites

164
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,040
out there, just hero and then some content.

165
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,350
So I'm going to uncommented the NAV.

166
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:18,810
And as soon as I do that, you'll see that we have it up here completely unstyled.

167
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:23,560
So in the next video, we're going to go ahead and style the NAV and add a little bit of JavaScript

168
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,710
to dynamically add and remove a class to basically give it that effect that I showed you in the intro.

169
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,160
All right.

170
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,570
So I'll see you in the next video.
