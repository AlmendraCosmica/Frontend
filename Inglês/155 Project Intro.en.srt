1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,370
All right, so in this project, we're going to create a to do list, which looks pretty nice, pretty

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,260
nice clean design, and we're able to add it to do down here.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:12,600
I'll just say to do one and you'll see that gets added.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,250
I'll see to do two.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,040
To do three.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,560
And it's just going to get keep getting added down here.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,940
Now, if I reload this, they're going to stay because we're actually going to implement local storage

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,490
at the end.

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,200
So first we're going to create the design or the the layout here.

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,650
Then we're going to add the functionality in the dorm where we can add it to do we can also mark as

11
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:35,370
completed.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,030
So if I left click, it's going to mark as complete and if I right click it'll actually delete that.

13
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,020
To do so.

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,290
We'll add the dorm functionality first and then add in.

15
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:51,030
The last video will go ahead and implement local storage so that you can leave the page or reload the

16
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,250
page and the to dos will stay.
