1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,040
All right, and this project, we're going to build a random image feed where we come to the page and

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,010
it's just going to get a bunch of random images for us and we'll be able to, in the JavaScript, put

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,780
in the number of rows we want here.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,660
I have five rows of images, three in each column or three columns in each row, I should say.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,050
And we're not using any kind of API or anything.

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:29,340
What we're going to do is get the images from this this neutral source start on, splash dot com random,

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,360
and then you can put slash and then a size like 300 by 300.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,670
OK, if I put, let's say 300 by three one, that's going to give me a different image.

9
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:49,470
And what we'll do is have that size will generate a random size and then insert those images into the

10
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,880
dorm using JavaScript.

11
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:55,260
So no API, no no feature requests or anything like that.

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,290
We're just going to insert random images into the dorm.

13
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,150
So this will be a very short project.

14
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:03,390
We can probably get it done in like a ten minute video.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,810
All right.

16
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,640
So let's get started.
