00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,320
All right, so in this project, we're going to be building an image carousel that will show a couple

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,680
of images and it's going to basically just slide through them.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,410
It's going to do it on its own.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,470
But we also have these buttons here where we can control it.

5
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,990
So I can go, you know, next, next.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,700
And if it gets to the end, it just goes back to the beginning so I can go next.

7
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,990
I can also go back like that.

8
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,460
And if we get to the beginning and click previous, it just goes to the to the end.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:27,330
All right.

10
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:28,400
So that's what we're building.

11
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,880
Let's go ahead and get into it.
