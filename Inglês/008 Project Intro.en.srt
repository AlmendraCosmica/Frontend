1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,100
All right, so in this project, we're going to build some progress steps and you might see these in

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:12,720
different kinds of websites with forms, you know, multi basically like multilevel forms, shopping

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:17,730
carts, things like that, just a progress bar that starts at one and just goes along here.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,530
So we're not going to have any form or anything, but we'll have these buttons to control the steps.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,510
So it starts at 1:00.

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,170
He's got this blue outline.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,210
If I click next, then it goes to two.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:35,100
So the line we get transition goes over to two to border lights up, click next again.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,510
And notice at the beginning, previous is disabled, so there's no reason to click previous.

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,100
And then we can keep going.

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:44,490
And when we click, when we get to the last one, the next is disabled.

12
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,740
OK, so we can just go back and forth.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,990
And if we're at the end disabled, if we're at the end here, then next is disabled.

14
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,530
All right.

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:58,530
So we'll start off with the HTML style, style it with CSFs and then we'll add the functionality with

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,280
JavaScript.
