1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,560
All right, so let's get started the should we should be able to do this in one video because it's not

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,130
too much.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:12,510
So let's add a title of random image feed and then we'll add the same for this one here.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:20,220
And all we really need in the HTML is a container to put everything to put our images in.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,920
So that's that's going to be it for the HTML.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,080
Now, before we do any styling, I just want to be able to get the images and put them in the dorm here.

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:34,910
So we're not actually using an API, like we're not making a request to an API that gives us imagery

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,280
URLs.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,280
We're going to use a random Eurail from UN Splash.

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,480
In fact, I'll just show you some make it a little bit easier to understand if I put in this.

11
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,960
You earlier saw start on splash dot com slash random.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,350
It's going to give me a random image.

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,940
Now, if I reload, it's going to be the same image.

14
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,120
So what we want to do in our script is, is create a bunch of image tags with this.

15
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,690
But we also need a size.

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,190
So like 300 times three hundred.

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:16,890
Give me a specific image, if I do three oh, one times whatever, 302, that's going to give me a different

18
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,340
image.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,910
So we want to use those image sizes as well.

20
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,710
And those should be random.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,200
So first thing we'll do is bring in our container.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,970
And as I'm as I'm going here, if it's becoming clear what I'm going to do, I would suggest pausing

23
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,650
the video and trying it yourself.

24
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,750
And I know I've said that over and over in this course.

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,740
I'll probably say it a million more times, but I definitely, you know, recommend doing that.

26
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,750
So let's use query selector here.

27
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,520
And we have a class of container.

28
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,330
Now, the UN you URL that we're going to use, I'm going to put that into a variable called Unflashy

29
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:09,000
URL, which is http s and then saw Stotz on splash dot com slash random slash.

30
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,490
So that's the like the root Eurail.

31
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:15,390
We do want to have a size, but we're going to generate that randomly.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,030
I'm also going to put the number of rows that we want.

33
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,280
So I want to get 10 rows of images with three images in each row.

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:28,590
So we'll have a for loop here and let's say let's equals zero.

35
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:34,410
And we want to say as long as I is less than whatever the rows is.

36
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,720
But we want to multiply that by three because we're going to have three images per row and then we want

37
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,710
to increment I.

38
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:52,140
And let's create an image tag so we can use create elements sorry, it should be document dot, create

39
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,210
elements and in here let's create an image tag and then for the source.

40
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:03,450
So image dot source, we're going to set that to some back text with the.

41
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:10,090
On Splash You, Earl, but we also need a random size, so down here we're going to have a function.

42
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,600
We have two functions.

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:16,400
One is going to be to get a random so get random number.

44
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:22,370
And we want a random number between like three hundred and three, ten.

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,550
So let's return from this function.

46
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:30,800
I want to round it down some math dot floor and here we want to take math dot random, which gives us

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:37,580
a random decimal and we want to multiply that by ten to give us, you know, a random number between

48
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,360
one and ten.

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,850
But we just want to add 300 to that.

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:49,340
OK, so if I go up here and I can still get a random number and we look in our console.

51
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:58,970
We get 306 by reload, three seven three three, three or six, so I want to now have a function to

52
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:06,590
get a random size and a random size being, you know, three, one times three or six or something like

53
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:06,950
that.

54
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,900
So let's return here.

55
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:18,190
And the tactics we're going to do get random number outside of the the curly brace will do at times

56
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,670
and X and then another get random number.

57
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:32,710
So if we go up here and we console log, get a random size, we get three or nine by three or seven,

58
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,360
there are two by three or seven.

59
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,210
So there's a lot of different combinations.

60
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:42,010
I mean, you might get a repeat image, but actually I know you won't because when you use the sizes,

61
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,020
it's always random.

62
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,260
I believe.

63
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:48,160
So now that we can get a random size, let's go up here.

64
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,280
And right after this on Splash you, Earl, we're going to put in get a random size, make sure you

65
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:58,690
put your parentheses, and then we just want to put that into the container.

66
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:04,570
So we'll grab the container and we'll append child because we're putting this inside the container,

67
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:11,800
all the images, and it's going to give us, you know, 10 rows of three.

68
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,830
So if I save that, you'll see that it's going to put all those images in the dorm.

69
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,320
Now, we want to style these.

70
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,910
You want to create our rose and stuff.

71
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,360
So in our stylesheet let's go ahead.

72
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,250
And for the body here, we're going to keep display flex flex direction column, align everything to

73
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:33,790
the center.

74
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:37,030
Let's get rid of overflow hidden so that we have scrollbar.

75
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:46,880
And instead of height 100 reports, let's do a mean height of one hundred reports.

76
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,580
So now we can see our title.

77
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,060
All right.

78
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,400
And then for the title, I'm just going to style that real quick.

79
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:03,000
Just add a margin here of let's do 10, Texel zero zero and let's do text align center.

80
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:08,140
I mean, technically, we don't need that, but we'll just add it and then for the container.

81
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:15,940
I want to display flaks, remember, all of the images are in the container, so if I turn the container

82
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:18,700
into a flex box, it turns them into a row.

83
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,310
And I want to just make sure I line items and justify content to center.

84
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:29,070
And then let's have them wrap on to the next line.

85
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,320
So do flex, wrap, wrap.

86
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,080
And we want to have we want three to be the max in the row.

87
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,210
So what we'll do is set a max with onto the container.

88
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,280
So Max with will do one thousand pixels because each one is going to be three hundred pixels.

89
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,400
So it shouldn't go past that.

90
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,410
All right.

91
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,250
And we're going to change the size, see how they're slightly different because of the sizes they're

92
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,230
all in the three hundred to 310 range, but they're slightly different.

93
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,370
So we will add a size onto the images.

94
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,510
So that's it for the container.

95
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,850
Now let's do the image.

96
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:18,430
So we'll do container image and let's just do an object fit cover.

97
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:28,480
We want to see the whole image and then we'll put some margin in between that and let's set the height

98
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:31,780
to three hundred pixels, also the width.

99
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:42,500
To 300 pixels now they're all going to be the same size and let's do a max width of one hundred percent

100
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:45,750
so they don't go out of the container and that should do it.

101
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:51,020
So if I reload, we should get a whole bunch of different random images.

102
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:56,090
And I mean, it's not going to be the most performant because we're just, you know, we're inserting

103
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,290
all these image tags.

104
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,640
But and some of them will repeat if they have the same size, apparently.

105
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,180
But yeah, we should have 10 rows total.

106
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,630
So let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.

107
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:15,530
And if you wanted to, you could change this to, let's say, five rows and save.

108
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:24,190
And now you're should only get five rows of images and you could even put a select box here at an event,

109
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,400
a change event to it.

110
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:31,160
When you select, you know, five or 10 or 20, you can change the rows and you could do something like

111
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,810
that to add onto it.

112
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:34,160
But that's all we're going to do.

113
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,290
It is responsive.

114
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,560
So we're using flex wrap, so it'll knock on to the next line.

115
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,320
So on small screens is just going to be I mean, the rows, I guess, doesn't you know, we don't have

116
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:50,990
ten rows because or five rows in this case because it's only everything is stacked.

117
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,080
But at full screen it's going to be whatever number of rows you put here.

118
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,120
All right.

119
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:01,070
So I know this is a really simple project, but it just kind of gives you an idea of how you can put

120
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,210
things into the dorm.

121
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:08,420
We have random images, random image sizes and putting them into the source attribute of the images

122
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,380
and then putting them into the container.

123
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,620
All right, that's it.

124
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,340
Let's move on to the next project.
