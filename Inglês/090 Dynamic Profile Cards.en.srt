1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,910
OK, so we're able to type in a user, get their profile data and console it, but we don't want to

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:06,180
do that.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:08,800
We want to add it to this card right here.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,460
So what we'll do is create a new function.

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:21,720
Let's go down here and say function and we're going to call this create let's call it create user card.

6
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,040
And it's going to take in a user.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:33,510
And we want to take, let's say, const card HTML.

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,850
So we're going to create a variable here called card HTML and set it to a set of tactics.

9
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,690
And then I'm going to grab what we have in our HTML, this card.

10
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,320
So this div right here, everything that's in Maine, I'm going to take that and cut that.

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,470
We don't actually need anything in here.

12
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,520
We'll save that's going to go away.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,520
And then in our script, in this variable right here in this template, literal, I'm going to just

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,610
go ahead and let's go like that and paste that in.

15
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,050
All right.

16
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,520
So create user card right now.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,820
It's just all static, you know, content.

18
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,550
But I'm going to go after the back to here and take mean.

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,300
Actually, we need to bring Main in, don't we.

20
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,070
Yeah.

21
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:28,530
So up here, let's go ahead and bring in, say, Maine, which has an idea of Maine, and then after

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,880
the template literal will say Maine dot enter html equals Maine.

23
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,830
I call it a card card html.

24
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,010
So card html.

25
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:54,980
And let's save that and then once we make the request right here, so we get the data and instead of,

26
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:04,760
you know, console logging, let's call create user card and let's pass in our data, which is the user

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,240
data.

28
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,060
And they get that gets passed in here right now.

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,790
It's going to be the same static, you know, content.

30
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:12,950
But let's just make sure that that works at least.

31
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:19,670
So if I type in, you know, Brad, enter, OK, so we get a card, but it's still has John Doe in it.

32
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,290
So let's change this stuff up.

33
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:27,170
We now have access to the user data, and if you want to see exactly what that gives you, we could

34
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:36,080
take this and you could just go right in your browser here and paste that in and put any GitHub username

35
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:37,700
and you're going to see what it gives you.

36
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,770
So you can see the avatar.

37
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:47,530
You Eurail is what we want, that we're going to want the user name right here.

38
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,070
We're going to want the bio.

39
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,550
So all this this data is available to you.

40
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,610
So let's go to the image here.

41
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,630
Let's get rid of that.

42
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:01,940
And let's put in here the user dot avatar underscore you URL.

43
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:07,670
And then for the ALZ, we'll go ahead and say user, let's do the user name.

44
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:16,040
And right here in the H2, we want to use user dot name and then the bios.

45
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:29,180
So let's get rid of this and let's add user dot bio and then we have down here, like our followers

46
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:39,940
will get rid of this 300 here and let's put in user dot followers and then we have our following user

47
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,190
dot following.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,250
And our repos is going to be user dot, public, underscore, rebholz.

49
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,080
And this is all coming from the API.

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,780
You can see right here, public repose.

51
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:02,770
You have other stuff like public gists, company blog you could use and then repost here.

52
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:07,150
We're just going to get rid of these because we're actually going to make another request to get those

53
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,020
and then insert.

54
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,060
But I'm just going to get rid of those for now.

55
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:12,010
So let's save that.

56
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:15,550
And let's go back to our application here.

57
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:20,260
And I'm going to search for my profile and then we go.

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:25,780
So we get my image, my name, my bio number of followers following.

59
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,530
I should follow some more people repos.

60
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:30,780
Good.

61
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:38,020
Now, we don't have the the Repos yet, like the you know, because we're going to get to the top five

62
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,000
repos or the latest five.

63
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,830
We're going to do that in the next video.

64
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:48,580
But what I do want to do is handle the error, because right now, if there's an error, like let's

65
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,980
put something that we know is probably not a name and nothing happens.

66
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,480
Well, something does happen at console logs right here.

67
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:06,760
So if there's an error, let's then let's get rid of this and let's call a function called create error

68
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:07,990
card.

69
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,620
All right, now what we could do it this way.

70
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,570
You can also check for specific responses like that would be a 404 because it wouldn't be found.

71
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,760
So we could do an F here.

72
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:37,860
And we could say if the error dot response DOT status is equal to a 404, then we want to do a create

73
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,580
error card.

74
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,930
And then you can check for other types of of responses as well.

75
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,730
But we'll just go ahead and leave it at this, because if it tries to find a user that doesn't exist,

76
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:50,240
it's going to be a 404 status.

77
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,350
So this create error card, let's actually you know what?

78
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,840
Let's put a message in here.

79
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:07,320
So create error card will take a message that says there is no or we'll just say no user.

80
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,900
No profile with this username.

81
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,820
All right, so we'll go down here and let's create that function function, create error card, which

82
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:29,920
takes in a message and we're just going to do the same thing we did above in the user card will create

83
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,670
a variable.

84
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:41,920
We'll call this card HTML and set this to template literal and we're going to have a div with the class

85
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,650
of card

86
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:56,980
and inside this div we're just going to have an H1 with whatever that message is.

87
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:07,050
OK, and then we'll take the main element and set the inner HTML equal to the card HTML.

88
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,260
So let's save that.

89
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:14,710
Now I'm going to type something in here that is definitely not a name and that didn't work.

90
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,610
See.

91
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,080
Reference error message is not to oh, I put a message MSG.

92
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,800
All right, let's try that again.

93
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,280
So no problem.

94
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,840
No profile with this username.

95
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:39,910
And it's going to tell us down here that it got a feel for as well in the console, but good.

96
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,600
That's what I want.

97
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,450
So then we could try, like, you know, Floren Pop 17 and we get Florens.

98
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,700
Beautiful picture and profile.

99
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,110
All right.

100
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,410
So in the next video, we want to work on the repositories.

101
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:59,800
We want to show the top five, not the top five, the most recent five down here with a link to click

102
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,140
on and visit those repositories.
