1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,280
All right, in this project, we're going to build a custom range slider, so in with a team of five,

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:11,420
you have an input type of range, but it's you can't really style it.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:17,640
You have to basically tell the browser that you don't want it to show and then you can style the track,

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,860
which is this part here, and you can style the thumb, which is this part here on your own.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,570
So that's what we're going to do and is going to be quite a bit of success because we have to pay attention

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,710
to which browser it's being shown on because it's different in every browser.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:39,840
So we'll have the Web kit prefix for, you know, safari and chrome emoji from A and from Microsoft.

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,870
And then we're going to add some JavaScript for this label so that it will show whatever the value is

9
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,220
from zero to 100.

10
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:52,470
But not only that, it's going to calculate the it's going to be this is positioned absolute and it's

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:59,430
going to calculate the left value to move it along with the thumb with a little ball here.

12
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,330
All right.

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,200
So it's just a nice little widget that you can use in your applications and stuff in your uses.

14
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:05,900
All right.

15
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,200
So let's go ahead and get started.
