1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,950
OK, so we're going to start on the JavaScript, which is going to be pretty easy, and I would challenge

2
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,690
you to try and do this yourself beforehand.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,790
Basically, we need to bring in all the contents, which are, you know, these images here with the

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:15,860
class of content.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,970
So query selector all will bring all those in.

6
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:22,790
You also want to bring all the list items in and then add an event listener on each of these.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,310
OK, so you might want to loop through with a for each and add an event listener and then you want to,

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,790
you know, add the class of active to whichever one you click on and also add the class of show to whichever

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,240
of these images or whichever content should show.

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:48,120
So let's say const contents and we use document got query selector all because it's more than one.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,340
We're going to select the class of content.

12
00:00:50,640 --> 00:01:00,240
And then let's also grab from the NAV you'll we want all the list items and we'll call this list items

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,810
and we'll take the list items and let's loop through those.

14
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,300
So for each and we'll pass in here and arrow function and say for each item.

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,340
And we also want to get the index.

16
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,350
So I'll just use IDEX here.

17
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,460
This should be a fat arrow and then let's add an eventless star.

18
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:31,230
So add eventless onto the item that we want to listen for a click and on Click we're going to first

19
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:37,010
of all, hide all the classes of show or I should say, remove all the classes of show and active.

20
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,110
So let's have two different functions.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,320
This will be hyd all contents and let's say hide all items.

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,830
OK, so we'll go down here and create these functions.

23
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:52,020
So hide all contents.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,420
And what we're gonna do here is take the contents and then for each one of those.

25
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:07,890
So for each content, which is each div with the class or I'm sorry, each image with the class of content.

26
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,210
Right.

27
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,000
Yeah.

28
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:10,260
So class of content.

29
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,400
We brought that in here.

30
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:18,720
Now we're looping through and we want to take whichever content is current in the iteration and remove

31
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,440
that class.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,390
So class of star remove of show.

33
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:37,860
OK, and then let's copy this and let's do hide all items and take say for each of the list items,

34
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,760
you will change that to item and let's remove the class of active.

35
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,380
OK, so I save that and I go and I click on one of these.

36
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,420
You'll see that there's no active class now on any of these because none of them are purple and there's

37
00:02:54,420 --> 00:03:00,210
no image showing because there's no more show, there's no more show class.

38
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,000
And the show class is what makes the opacity one.

39
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,330
The opacity is zero by default.

40
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,630
So after we initially hide those, let's take the item that we click on and let's take the class list

41
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:16,440
and add to it the class of active.

42
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:27,320
So if I click on this one here, you'll see that this is active, this is active and so on, and then

43
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,560
we also want to add the class of show on to the correct content.

44
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:41,600
So here, let's say contents and remember, contents is a node list, so I can access zero one whatever

45
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,620
index I want.

46
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:49,330
I want to use the index from this foreach so that the first one shows the first one second item shows

47
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,520
a second and so on.

48
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,420
So we want to add that class of show on to that.

49
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,870
So now we start off here.

50
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,690
This is already active because, you know, we have it right here.

51
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,770
And then if we click on the second one, this will be active.

52
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:06,560
It's purple and it should show the second image.

53
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,780
OK, the second one in the node list, this one here will show the next one.

54
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,080
This one will show that one.

55
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:18,800
OK, so it's always going to show the correct one because of the index that we're adding that show class

56
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,410
on to.

57
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,010
OK, so hopefully that makes sense.

58
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,620
So I will see you in the next video.
