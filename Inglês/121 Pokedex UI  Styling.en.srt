1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,110
All right, so we're going to get started, I have my project starter open here, and I'm just going

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:11,610
to change the title here to pokey decks and we're going to have an H1 with pokey decks.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,980
And I think that we're going to have a container that wraps around everything, which will have a class

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,570
of pokey dash container.

5
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:27,120
I'm also going to give you an idea of pokey container and inside here will be basically each card is

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,380
going to have a class of Pokémon and these are going to be there's going to be a bunch of these and

7
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,390
it's going to ultimately come from the JavaScript.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,880
We're going to construct this div in the JavaScript, fetch the data and put the data inside here and

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,810
then put it in the dorm.

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:48,270
But right now I'm just going to hard code the HTML just so we can see it and we can at least style the

11
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,720
card.

12
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,950
So they're going to have an inline background.

13
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,810
So let's say style here and set the background color because each type is going to have a specific background

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,230
color.

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,230
OK, so apparently Pokémon, they have different types.

16
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,740
I honestly have never even looked at Pokémon, so I have no clue about it.

17
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,840
All I know is the data that we're fetching.

18
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,480
So if you're a big Pokemon fan and I make a mistake, please don't, you know, get pissed off at me.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,750
So let's set the background.

20
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,630
I'm sorry, did that set the background color to be so red, green, blue.

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,310
Two, two, two, two, five, three and two to four.

22
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,250
OK, and then inside here, we want to have an image container div.

23
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,060
So let's say image container and then an image.

24
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,250
And I'm just going to grab the link here.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,210
So this is a link to the Bulbasaur Pokémon.

26
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:51,720
So it's looks like this and it's going to be really big to begin with.

27
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,970
But when we get to the success, we'll fix that up.

28
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:59,550
So under the image container here, we're going have a class of info which will have some info on this

29
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,750
particular Pokémon.

30
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:06,240
So spane, let's give this a class of no and just hardcoded in here, zero zero one.

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,670
Ultimately, like I said, this stuff is going to come from, you know, the API.

32
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:22,320
So H3 with a class of name and we'll say it's Balbus or Balbus or like that, I believe.

33
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,460
And then small tag here with a class of type.

34
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,130
And let's just put a label of type and then another spane.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,260
And inside here is going to be the type name which in this case is grass.

36
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,110
OK, so that should do it.

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:45,150
I'm also going to put a link to the design that this was inspired by from Dribble.

38
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,790
So I'm just going to pass that in down here just to give them credit.

39
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,650
All right.

40
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,820
Actually, one more thing I want to do is just create a couple of these cards.

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,220
So this divide the class of Pokémon, let's just copy that down twice so that there's three of these.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,070
OK, so we have three of these cards.

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,240
And ultimately, again, this will be coming from the JavaScript, so we won't have this HTML in this

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,100
file, but we just want it.

45
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,080
There's a style.

46
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:17,230
So we're going to use the little fonts I'm going to grab from here to here and let's say questionmark

47
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:20,530
family set that to lieto.

48
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,570
So let's go.

49
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:26,500
And then Colen 300 and 400.

50
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,070
And then let's add that font family here.

51
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,540
So change that and then the background, so for the background, we're going to use a linear gradient,

52
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,920
but for any browser that doesn't support that, we're going to put a solid color first.

53
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,600
So EAFE, FBB will be the solid background.

54
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,130
And I know we can't really see it because of the cards here, but we'll fix that in a minute.

55
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:59,470
And then let's also set another set, another background here as a linear gradient direction will be

56
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,610
to the right.

57
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:11,280
First color is going to be D four D, three D D and then comma and then the next color will be EFP FPP.

58
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:17,710
OK, so that'll be the background which we can't currently see, and then all the Fleck's stuff can

59
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,510
stay, the alignment will get rid of the height 100 viewport, we'll get rid of the overflow hidden

60
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,280
because we do want scroll bars.

61
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,170
And now you can see the background gradient here.

62
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,710
So for the H1, I just want to separate out the letters.

63
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,130
A little soul set the letter spacing to three pixels.

64
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:48,270
And let's do the container, so the pokey dash container that wraps around everything on want to display

65
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,910
that as flax.

66
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:58,200
So if we look at our e-mail poky container wraps, all of these Pokémon, so basically all the cards.

67
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,720
So we want to use flex box to turn those into flex items into a row.

68
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:06,060
So display flex, it's going to put them side by side.

69
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,130
And I know the image is giant right now, but we'll fix that in a few minutes.

70
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,270
We want to display flaks.

71
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,960
We want it to WRAP'S If it goes out of its container, it'll wrap onto the onto the next line.

72
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,450
OK, and you can see now that it dropped down to the next line.

73
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:29,550
As far as the remaining space, we want to align items to space between.

74
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:41,720
And then let's justify content to the center and we want it to be in the middle, let's say margin zero,

75
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:49,790
top and bottom, auto left and right, and then offset a max width of twelve hundred pixels and we will

76
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,990
make this responsive.

77
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:59,930
OK, so now we have the class of Pokémon which wraps around all of you know, each one has a class of

78
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,250
Pokémon on each card.

79
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:10,430
And for this let's set a back an initial background color of Tripoli.

80
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,040
But these are going to be called background colors are going to be dynamic depending on whatever the

81
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,820
type is.

82
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,190
OK, but we'll set it to that initially.

83
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,020
Let's set the border radius to 10 pixels.

84
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,100
Actually, you know what?

85
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,230
We can't even see any of this.

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,440
So let's do the image.

87
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,940
Let's just take care of that image.

88
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:36,020
So the Pokémon image, Dasch container, let's do that first.

89
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:44,150
And for the container, we're going to set a background color of our GBA white.

90
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,640
So two five, five, four, Rajeeb.

91
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:53,570
And then for the alpha value will do zero point six for that.

92
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,620
Right.

93
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,600
And then we want these to be rounded images, but we're going to put the border radius on the image

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,320
container.

95
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,390
So that's going to be 50 percent.

96
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:12,290
And I want to have a with and height of 120 pixels.

97
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:21,460
Okay, so right now, the images is you can see these are lined up and you can see the image container,

98
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,000
but the images are busting out of the container.

99
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:32,740
So before we actually add anything on to that, I just want to do text line center.

100
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:41,620
But then for the images, let's grab this and say for each image, I want to set a max width on that

101
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:45,300
image to be 90 percent of its container.

102
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,150
So that will put it inside its container, which is that, you know, this right here.

103
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:57,850
And let's just also add a margin to a margin, top of 20 pixels.

104
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:08,290
All right, so now that we've done that, let's go back to to this class right here, the Pokémon class,

105
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:11,380
and I want to box shadow on these cards.

106
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,840
So let's set the box shadow here.

107
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:22,720
Will do zero four vertical I'm sorry, horizontal three pixels for the V offset and then 15 pixels for

108
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,460
the blur and then for the color.

109
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,880
It'll be Vuh.

110
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:32,560
Let's do 100 for each of those and then zero point five for the transparency.

111
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:37,270
So you can see now we have that box shadow for spacing.

112
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,210
Let's add the margin to ten pixels that will bring them apart.

113
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,250
We need some spacing inside the card.

114
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,030
So let's do twenty pixels inside and you can see it.

115
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:51,340
This gets knocked on to the next line because we have flex wrap.

116
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,710
If we didn't have this flex wrap right here, then it's not going to do that.

117
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:05,130
But this will help us make it responsive, and then finally, I just want to text a line to the center

118
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:10,700
right now for the bottom part here, the info.

119
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,520
Let's do that.

120
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,520
So it's a Pokémon dot info.

121
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,940
All I want on this particular class is a margin, top of 20 pixels.

122
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,810
So it's going to push everything down a little bit.

123
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,070
And then I want to style the number.

124
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,770
So it's a Pokémon info.

125
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:42,130
No, so I'm going to add a background color here and I'm going to use RGB because I want it to be like

126
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,280
a transparent looking background.

127
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,150
So let's do black and then zero point one.

128
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,870
OK, so you can see it gives it that transparent background.

129
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,210
Look, we're going to have a little bit of padding to it.

130
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:07,900
Let's do five pixels, top and bottom, 10 pixels left and right and set the border radius and we'll

131
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,640
do 10 pixels on that.

132
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,440
And let's make it a little smaller.

133
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:18,090
We'll do font size and we'll set it to zero point zero point eight AM units.

134
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,680
So that's going to just be whatever the the wrapper is, the container font size, it's going to multiply

135
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,380
it by zero point eight, which is going to make it a little smaller.

136
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,210
OK, so last thing is the name.

137
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:46,300
So it's a Pokémon info name at the margin to let's do 15 07 and then let's just do the letter spacing

138
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,680
to one pixel.

139
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:54,990
All right, so it looks pretty good and you see, if I extend it, it'll go they'll all be on the same

140
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:55,400
line.

141
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,710
So that's a success.

142
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:04,710
In the next video, we want to actually fetch this data because right now it's just we just put it in

143
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,550
the HTML.

144
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,420
We want to go ahead and fetch it from the API and inserted into the DOM.
