1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,490
All right, guys, we're going to get started on the 3D box's background project, so I have my project

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:07,880
starter open my three files here.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,530
Now, the HTML for this is going to be really simple.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,130
It's actually only going to have two lines in the body.

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:20,250
One will be the button and one will be the box container and then the individual 16 boxes that are going

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,110
to transform into one box.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:26,060
When we click the button, those are going to be created from within the JavaScript.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,020
However, for now, until we get to that, I will just hardcoded them and then we'll remove them later

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,120
on and and add our JavaScript.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:33,750
All right.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,810
So let's go ahead and get started here.

12
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:45,570
Let's just change the title to see 3D Box's background and let's get rid of this H1 and let's put our

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,370
button so we have a button.

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,200
And I'm going to give you an idea of BTN and a class of magic.

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,120
And inside here we'll see magic.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,200
And I'm just going to paste in an emoji here.

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,240
You don't have to, but if you want that, you can just grab it from the repository and then we're going

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,740
to have our boxes container.

19
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:10,350
This is going to have an idea of boxes because we do need to use it within the JavaScript and for styling

20
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,060
we'll add a class of boxes.

21
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,580
And inside here, like I said, this is ultimately going to come from the JavaScript, but for now,

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,140
we're just going to hard code them.

23
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,460
So let's go ahead and say a class of box and we want 16.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,250
So we're going to do asterisked 16 enter and that will give us 16 divs with the class of box.

25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,870
Go ahead and save that.

26
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,770
And all we're going to see is the button, because obviously these are just empty divs.

27
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,870
But we have to go ahead and style these.

28
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,510
So let's jump into our style access.

29
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:43,110
And we have our our boilerplate, our Raboteau font.

30
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,750
We are going to use the Poppins font for the buttons.

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:53,120
So what I'll do is just go ahead and duplicate this and let's go right here, right before the ampersand,

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,800
get rid of this and let's put in toppings like that.

33
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,920
And then down here in the body, we're just going to add a background color, a very light gray.

34
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,770
So it's going to be F A three times.

35
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:11,370
Can't even see the difference, but just a light gray background.

36
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:16,670
And then let's start on the styling for the button, which has a class of magic.

37
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,990
So it's magic.

38
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,370
And we're going to give this a background color of a yellow.

39
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:30,540
So we'll use hexadecimal here with the value of F nine, C A two for.

40
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,340
OK, so that would be the background.

41
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,860
The color is going to be white.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,920
Let's add our font family here of Hobbins.

43
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:51,240
Sans serif, save that good, want to get rid of that ugly border and let's make let's give it some

44
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,350
rounded corners.

45
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:04,110
So border radius, border radius, I'm going to do three pixels and let's make the font size 16 pixels.

46
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,350
Add some padding to make this bigger.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,430
Will do twelve on the top and bottom 20 on the left and right.

48
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:10,880
Good.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,640
We want to have a cursor pointer so that when we hover over it we have our pointer.

50
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,100
Let's, let's position this to the top.

51
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,100
So I'm going to use position fixed which we'll position it fixed in the browser window and we'll see

52
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,620
from the top 20 pixels.

53
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,400
So let's move it up and then let's also add some letter spacing to space out the letters a little.

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,230
We'll do one pixel for that.

55
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,620
Good.

56
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,590
And let's see, we're also going to add a little box shadow on the bottom.

57
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:50,670
So for Box Shadow, we have our X offset, which I'm going to set to zero, and then the Y offset.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,550
I'm going to set that to three pixels because I just want it to be slightly on down here on the Y axis,

59
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,630
right on the bottom.

60
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,220
And then for the color we'll use in RGB, a yellow.

61
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,210
So red, green, blue, alpha.

62
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:11,340
So two four nine four four red, 202 for green, thirty six for blue and then for the alpha, which

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,980
is the transparency will do zero point five.

64
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,400
So now you can see that there's a slight box shadow underneath.

65
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,780
All right.

66
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:23,700
Now I want to get rid of this ugly outline on the focus state.

67
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,700
So what we can do is take the magic class and say focus state.

68
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,470
We want to set the outline property to not get rid of that.

69
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,360
And then I also want to an effect that when we click, click and hold, when it's in its active state,

70
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,470
that it moves down a little bit and gets rid of the box shadow.

71
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,340
So it gives the effect of it's going over the box shadow.

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,570
So how we can do that is with magic in the active state.

73
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:58,140
We want to first remove the box shadows or set box shadow to none, and then we'll go ahead and set

74
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,100
the transform property and we're going to use translate.

75
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,580
Why?

76
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,840
Because we want to translate.

77
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,610
We want to move it along the Y axis, just two pixels, which will move it down.

78
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,130
If I did negative two pixels, it would move it up.

79
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,660
So let's save that.

80
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,430
And now you can see when I click and hold it basically like covers that box shadow.

81
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,050
All right.

82
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:26,940
So I'm also going to add to this magic button, a Z index of we'll just put one hundred because I want

83
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:34,020
it to always be on top, even if the browser is really short and the image the boxes go underneath,

84
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,430
I want the button to be on top.

85
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:36,570
All right.

86
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,860
So that takes care of that.

87
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,630
Now we're going to start on the boxes.

88
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:46,710
So we have the boxes container and then we have the individual box class.

89
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,700
Right now, I want to be able to see what we're doing with the boxes.

90
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:57,030
So for now, I'm just going to add a background of yellow and the height and the width here are very

91
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:57,780
important.

92
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,990
So that's going to be one twenty five for both.

93
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,340
OK, so the width is going to be one twenty five.

94
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:12,450
Now the reason for that is because the box is the container is going to have to do a height.

95
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,700
Is going to have a Hitner with a 500.

96
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:27,590
Which is one one twenty five times four is 500, and we want four across now to create the rows and

97
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:33,590
columns with with our success, we'll go ahead and use flex box on the container.

98
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,860
So let's say display flex.

99
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,560
As soon as I do that, they all get put in a row.

100
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,050
However, they're not being knocked down to the next.

101
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,770
I mean, there's only four that can fit here.

102
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,370
So I want them to wrap.

103
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:51,500
Basically, if it hits the edge, I want them to go on to the next line, create a new row so we can

104
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,760
say flex wrap and set that to wrap.

105
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:01,310
OK, now the reason it looks like one big block is because the numbers here are exact, right?

106
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,770
One twenty five times four is five hundred.

107
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,980
So there's no in between here.

108
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:13,590
Now, ultimately what I want to do is click this button and have them separate, have each box separate.

109
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:17,770
So what I'll do is I'll add a class onto this called big.

110
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,520
OK, I'm going to save that.

111
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:27,290
And then I'm going to say down here, if if the box is class, also has a big class, then let's go

112
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:30,500
ahead and extend the width and the height to six hundred pixels.

113
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,460
OK, so from 500 to 600, 600.

114
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,770
And that's going to make the container bigger.

115
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,670
Now this obviously doesn't look right.

116
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,550
We want this remaining space over here to be around each element, around each box.

117
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:54,770
So what we can do is where we where we display flex here, we can set the justified content to be space

118
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,520
around.

119
00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,500
Now, if I save that, you can see now the remaining space is around each element.

120
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,070
All right.

121
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:08,720
We're also just going to add a position so that position relative to boxes and then down here for each

122
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,980
box, let's go ahead and replace the yellow with an image with that gif.

123
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,790
OK, so we're going to say background image and we want to set that to you, Earl.

124
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:24,980
And the link I'm just going to paste and this is from Jiffy dot com.

125
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:29,510
And if you want to use a different gif from this website or something else, you can do that.

126
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:32,180
So I'm going to go ahead and save that.

127
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:39,230
And now you can see that we just have this this one image in every box as the background.

128
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,100
All right.

129
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,190
Now, ultimately, we're going to want to change the positioning and the size of each of these.

130
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:53,780
So let's let's actually add a background repeat and we'll set that to no repeat.

131
00:08:54,050 --> 00:09:02,990
And then for the for the size background size, we want to set this to the same size as the the initial

132
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,890
boxes because we want it to take up that entire thing.

133
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,380
Right now we have the class of big on, so it's at 600.

134
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:16,910
But ultimately we want the size to be 500 pixels on X and Y.

135
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,390
OK, so now you can see that it's stretched out and you can only see part of the image and it's the

136
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,070
same part in each box.

137
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:31,530
But later on we're going to change the positioning of each of these so that it looks like one big image.

138
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,740
All right.

139
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,470
So let's see the next thing that we'll do here.

140
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:43,460
We want to have a position of relative on this because we're going to be using the before and after

141
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:46,670
pseudo selector to give that that cubed border look.

142
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,570
And we need to position that absolute.

143
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,340
So we want the container of that to be relative.

144
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,340
Now, another thing we want to do is when we do click this button, what's going to happen is it's going

145
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,780
to toggle this big class, OK?

146
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,710
So it's going to go from that to that.

147
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:06,500
And when that happens, I want to have a rotate effect.

148
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:13,940
So we want to add a rotation to to to the boxes if it has that big class.

149
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:18,330
So let's go right here and let's say so.

150
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,930
Boxes has the big class.

151
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:30,890
We want that each individual box to have a transform and we're going to use rotate Z with a 360 degree

152
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,850
angle, OK?

153
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,180
Now we want this.

154
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,360
When this happens, we want it to transition nicely.

155
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,960
So let's add a transition on two boxes.

156
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:53,000
So transition just so you know it rotate smoothly and we'll use four point four seconds with an EZ effect.

157
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,290
And then I'm just going to copy this and put the transition in the box as well.

158
00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:02,090
And now as soon as I save, you can see that it actually does that effect.

159
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,560
OK, because when that big class gets added, it will go ahead and do that.

160
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,070
And we're going to make this button ultimately add and remove that class, which will make it toile

161
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,890
into place.

162
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,140
OK, so it'll twirl or.

163
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,860
I should say rotate and then go all together, and then it'll rotate and split apart.

164
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:25,970
All right.

165
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,150
Hopefully that makes sense.

166
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:34,130
Now, the last thing that I want to do here is add that kind of that cubed effect.

167
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:40,070
So not only do we want, like a border on the right and the left, but we want it to skew.

168
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,140
So it goes like this at an angle.

169
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:49,670
So to to do this, to do the right side, we're going to use the after pseudo selector so we can take

170
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,350
the box class and then say double colon after.

171
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,830
And you can use this to insert content.

172
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:00,340
It needs this content value and we could even put something in here.

173
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,910
And now you can see that after that box element, it puts telo.

174
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,110
But we don't want that.

175
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,460
We just want to leave this blank.

176
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:12,680
The only reason we need this is to add some styling so you can think of it as kind of like a like an

177
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,860
invisible element.

178
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:23,630
So as for the styling, let's go ahead and add a background color and we're going to use the background

179
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:32,060
color of F what is it, F sixty five eight D it's going to be the background.

180
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,710
We're not going to see anything just yet.

181
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:36,460
We need to add the sizing and position and stuff like that.

182
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:46,730
So we want to position this absolute OK, so we're positioning in absolute and you need to have relative

183
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,190
on the box because absolute should be.

184
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,870
It's relative to the box.

185
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,170
Right.

186
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,810
And then for the positioning, the coordinates will do eight pixels from the top.

187
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:02,570
We want because we want to push it down a little bit because we're going to add that skew and then over

188
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:09,860
let's do from the right let's do negative 15 pixels because we want it to be, you know, going this

189
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,220
way.

190
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:17,360
And then for the height, we want it to take up one hundred percent of its container, which in this

191
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,950
case is the box itself.

192
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,160
And then the width is going to be 15 pixels.

193
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:28,400
So if I save that, you can see we have this yellow part here and it's pushed down a little bit because

194
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,030
of this eight.

195
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,080
In fact, if I put a zero here, you can see it's flash.

196
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,350
However, I want to use that.

197
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,240
I want to have that SKU effect here and here.

198
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,530
So it'll be on both sides.

199
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:47,150
And to do that, we can just use transform and we want to skew on the Y axis because it's up and downs

200
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:47,660
vertical.

201
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,600
So skew y forty five degrees.

202
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,390
And if I save that now, you can see we have that effect of it's coming off here and going, you know,

203
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:59,780
at a skewed angle on both the top and bottom.

204
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,180
Now we want to do the same thing here.

205
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,070
We basically want to come from here and go over so it looks like has that 3D effect.

206
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,740
So I'm actually going to just copy this whole thing and now we're going to use before.

207
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,110
OK, and for the background color, we're going to change it slightly.

208
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:20,130
We're going to use the same yellow robes.

209
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,630
We're going to use the same yellow that we used.

210
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:32,750
Or is it or is the yellow that I used for the button right here.

211
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,370
So we're going to just we'll just copy this background color here and set that here.

212
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,560
OK, just slightly different yellow.

213
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,590
And for the positioning, we want it to be absolute, although we want to change.

214
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,120
We're going to go let's see from the bottom.

215
00:14:54,860 --> 00:15:01,370
We want to go negative fifteen and then from the left.

216
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,190
We want to go eight pixels.

217
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,190
OK, so it's basically the reverse of what we had before and then the height, the width is going to

218
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,140
be 100 percent and then the height will be 15.

219
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:18,680
So it's basically just the horizontal version of what we just did.

220
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,820
And then we want to skew on the x axis because it's horizontal.

221
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:23,960
So I'll save that.

222
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:27,700
And now you can see we basically have that same thing, but going this way.

223
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:33,300
So what we want to do in the next video is, of course, we want to add the functionality where we click

224
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:39,390
this button and it does its little rotate and goes into what looks like one big image.

225
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,800
And we want to be able to toggle that.

226
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,330
But we also need to change the background position.

227
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:49,680
We need to make that dynamic within these boxes, because right now they're just all in the same position,

228
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,480
which obviously doesn't look right.

229
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,520
We want it to look like it's one big image.

230
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,150
All right.

231
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,770
So that's what we're going to get into next.
