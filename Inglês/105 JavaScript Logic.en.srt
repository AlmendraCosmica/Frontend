1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,250
OK, so in the last video, we did our little animation, and right now we can put these wherever we

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,290
want, but I want to make it so that if we try to do all three, it's not going to let us do good,

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:11,270
cheap and fast.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,780
So we want to have it.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,150
So, you know, it can do cheap and good.

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,810
It can do cheap and fast, but it can't do all three.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,500
So first thing I want to do is bring in everything we need.

8
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,680
Let's bring in the toggles, which is the checkbox themselves.

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:34,320
So let's say document dot, query selector, all because there's more than one and we want all the ones

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,420
of the class of toggle and then let's get each.

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,920
Basically we want to grab, you know, the the label.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm not not the label but the idea of good, cheap and fast.

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:53,590
So toggles gets all of these, but we want each individual one by its side.

14
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:57,360
So here we'll say I good.

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:04,670
This is going to be query selector and set this to good.

16
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:15,750
And then this one here is going to be cheap query selector and let's do I d of cheap and then this is

17
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,640
going to be fast so I'd fast.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,460
Make sure you use query selector since it's a single element and fast.

19
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,580
So we were bringing in everything we need.

20
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,750
Now I'm going to take toggles and I'm going to loop through with a for each and see for each toggle.

21
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,110
Let's add an event listener.

22
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:45,240
So say toggle dot add event listener and the event is going to be a change.

23
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,160
When you have a checkbox and you want to add an event to it, you want to use change, not click.

24
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:59,490
So when that runs will have a function and we're going to have a function run called Do the Trick.

25
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:10,300
And passing the target value, which is the whatever we select and we have to pass in here our event

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:10,990
object.

27
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,550
OK, so now each time we click on one of these, it's going to, you know, fire off the change event

28
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:23,460
and it's going to do the trick and pass in whatever the target is passing that element.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:31,330
So let's create a function called Do the Trick and it's going to take in we'll call the collect one.

30
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,020
That's what it is.

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,150
It's the one we clicked on.

32
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:43,120
And we want to check first to see if all three are checked so we can say if good dot checked, because

33
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,760
when you have a checkbox, you bring it into the dorm.

34
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,980
You can you can access if it's checked or not with Dorchak, then it'll be a true or false.

35
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:58,960
So we'll say if good is checked, if cheap is checked and if fast.

36
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,270
Checked.

37
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:10,470
OK, so if that's true, let's say if good is equal to the clipped one.

38
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,590
So basically the you know, the clipped one, meaning the target that's passed, and then we're going

39
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,440
to say fast dot checked and we want to uncheck it.

40
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,880
So we're going to set that to false.

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,870
OK, and then let's say if.

42
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,890
Cheap is the correct one.

43
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:42,560
OK, so if we click on cheap, then we'll take good and let's get checked and set that to false.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,010
And then if we have fast that's clicked, then we want to set cheap checked to false.

45
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,830
All right, so let's save that.

46
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:04,260
Now, if I go on a good cheap and then I click fast, you'll see cheap automatically slide back over

47
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,800
because it's it's set back to false right here.

48
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:13,440
OK, if I click cheap then good is going to be unchecked.

49
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:17,700
If I click good fast is going to be unchecked.

50
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:25,890
OK, if if cheap is already selected we can do good and not cheap and not fast.

51
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:26,760
We can do fast.

52
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,780
Not cheap, not good.

53
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,130
We can do cheap and fast or good.

54
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,450
But we can't do all three.

55
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,340
Ah it's very rare at least.

56
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,290
So it's just a fun little project.

57
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:45,240
And you know, you could use these nice sliders, these style checkboxes in your UI.

58
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,410
The, the logic here was just really for fun.

59
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:50,480
But that's it.

60
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,350
Let's go ahead and get started on the next one.
