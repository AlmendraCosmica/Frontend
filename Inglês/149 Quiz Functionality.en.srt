1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,480
OK, so now we want to go ahead and make this quiz function, we just have the UI for it now.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,990
So for the quiz, for the questions and all that, it's going to go into an array.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,740
And I'm just going to paste this in because I don't want to just type all this out.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,110
And basically we have just a variable called quiz data.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:26,130
It's an array of objects that has a question and it has an ABCDE answer and then it also has a correct.

6
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,510
So the correct is obviously going to be whichever one of these is correct.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,850
And we just have some simple questions here.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,650
Which language runs in a Web browser?

9
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,140
What is CSFs HTML stand for?

10
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,540
What year is JavaScript launch?

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,040
Obviously you can change this, but we're going to go ahead and go with these questions.

12
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,420
Now, let's bring in everything we need.

13
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,830
First of all, we need the quiz itself, which wraps around everything.

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:59,730
So it's to document doGet Element by D and we're going to get the ID of quiz now for the answers.

15
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,340
So let's say Consed and we'll call this answer Owles.

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:13,340
So answer elements and we want to use document dot query selector all because there's more than one

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:13,700
member.

18
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,010
Each of these has a class of answers.

19
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:18,350
So that's what we want to get here.

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,260
So it's a class of answer and then we want the question element.

21
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:34,350
So let's say consed question element and that's going to be document dot get element by D and the H2.

22
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:37,330
The question has an idea of question.

23
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:41,880
Now we want all the the answer IDs.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:51,690
So basically you know a a text through D text, so let's say const a underscore text and set that to

25
00:01:51,690 --> 00:02:00,240
document dot get element by D and that's going to be a underscore text and then I'm going to copy this

26
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,790
down three more times.

27
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,570
So this one.

28
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,440
This one.

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,790
Let's change that to be.

30
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,420
This one and this one will change to see this one, and this one will change too deep.

31
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,330
OK, and then finally, we just need to submit button.

32
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:23,650
So let's say consed submit beaten and set that to document dot get element bidi and we're going to get

33
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,080
the idea of submit.

34
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,970
OK, so that's everything we need.

35
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,540
For now.

36
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,500
We need an index of basically the question are the current quiz.

37
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:40,860
I guess each one of these pages in each one of these is going to be a quiz.

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:48,910
So let's say CONSED and we want the current quiz, which is going to always start at zero.

39
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,230
Right, because it's an array, it's going to zero, it starts in a zero index.

40
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,300
And actually we're going to set this this is going to change and be reassigned.

41
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,770
So we want to use the let here.

42
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,390
And then let's also create a variable for the score, which obviously starts at zero.

43
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,960
And then we're going to call load quiz, which is a function that we're going to create right now.

44
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:26,330
So low quiz, we want to get the current quiz data, so let's say consed current quiz data and we'll

45
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:31,550
set that to quiz data, which is the array that we have above.

46
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:36,050
And then the index for this is going to be the current quiz values.

47
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:39,830
So this right here, which is initially set to zero.

48
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:44,150
All right, then we want to get the question aliments.

49
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,860
So question Ã€lex, that should be a lowercase L.

50
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,450
OK, so question element in urtext.

51
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:05,910
And we're going to set that to whatever the current current quiz data question is, because current

52
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:12,060
quiz data is one of the objects in the array and we have a question value.

53
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,190
So that's what we're getting here and we're going to put it into that in our text.

54
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:20,270
So if I save, we're going to see the first one here which language runs in a Web browser.

55
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,610
If I change the current quiz, too, we're going to see the second question.

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:24,720
All right.

57
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,340
I'm sorry.

58
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,140
That would be the third one would be the second question.

59
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,320
OK, now for the for the answers.

60
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:41,490
Remember, we have a underscore text and we're going to set the inner text and let's set that to current

61
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,950
quiz data.

62
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,850
Dot a.

63
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,330
Because if we look and know, if we look up here, each one of these has a value, that's what we're

64
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:57,630
getting here and putting it into the underscore text I.D. We want to do the same for the other three.

65
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:07,980
So that'll be B and this will be B, text C text will be current quiz DataDot C, and then this one

66
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,880
will be D.

67
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:16,380
Now one issue we're going to have when we add our eventless are on the submit and we load the next quiz

68
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:23,190
or the next, you know, question answer that we're going to have the something selected and we want

69
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,190
to deselect everything beforehand.

70
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,510
So right.

71
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:36,030
When we load load the quiz here, let's called what's called deselect answers and then we'll create

72
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,560
that function down here.

73
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,300
So deselect answers, and this is pretty simple.

74
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:50,220
We already have our answers elements, which is a no list because we query selecter all and we just

75
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:57,960
want to loop through so for each and we'll say for each answer element, then let's set the at that

76
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,730
particular answer element.

77
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:07,260
We want to set the check to value equal to false which will remove any checks or any selections.

78
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,610
All right.

79
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:13,830
Now let's add an event listener so we have our submit button.

80
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,340
We want to add an event listener.

81
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,770
So we want to listen for a click event.

82
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:26,920
And when it's clicked, we're going to call a function and we need to get the answer.

83
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,500
So let's say CONSED answer and we'll set that to a function called Get Selected and we'll put that function

84
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,730
right up here, get selected and I'm going to initialize answer.

85
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,610
So I'm just going to initialize this variable and then take the answer elements and loop through.

86
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:56,580
So for each answer, for each answer element then I want to check to see which one is checked.

87
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:04,530
So we'll do an if statement here and just say if that particular answer element dot checked, which

88
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:13,430
gives us a true or false, then let's set answer equal to the answer element dot I.D..

89
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,540
OK, we're going to set it to whatever the ideas.

90
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,130
And then after this for each year, we're just going to return the answer.

91
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,690
All right, so that will get us the answer.

92
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,520
In fact, let's test that out if we do a console log of answer and then I'm going to go over here,

93
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,300
open up my console, I'm going to choose C, which is obviously wrong.

94
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:44,960
But you can see that at log's B, Python is C, Java is A, JavaScript is D, so we're getting the not

95
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,950
the correct answer, but we're getting the answer that's selected.

96
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,990
So now we want to match that with the correct answer.

97
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:58,460
So let's get rid of that and we'll say if there's an answer.

98
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:11,460
So if I answer, then we want to check to see if the answer is equal to the correct answer, which remember

99
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,660
is in the array, so we can use whois data and we want whatever the current quiz is.

100
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:26,450
So we pass in that current quiz index, which starts at zero, and we want to check the correct value.

101
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,290
So if the answer that we select is equal to that, then we know that that's correct.

102
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,320
So we want to take the score and just increment it by one.

103
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,640
So just score plus.

104
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,150
Plus.

105
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:41,700
OK, then we want to go on to the next quiz.

106
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,540
So I'm basically saying each each of these screens is a quiz.

107
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,270
So we'll take the current quiz and we'll just increment it to move on to the next.

108
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:59,800
Now let's check to see if the current quiz is less than the length of the array.

109
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,850
So if if it's less than the quiz data, the length, that means we're not at the end.

110
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,620
So we want to once again called load quiz or else.

111
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,450
So that means that we're at the end.

112
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:18,210
We answered the last question that I'm going to take the quiz element, which is just the entire wrapper,

113
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,880
and I'm going to set the entire HTML and let's add that to some back ticks.

114
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,330
And in here we'll put in H2 and just say you answered

115
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,870
correctly at and then we're going to put the score so in here.

116
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:47,700
So score slash and then whatever the length of the quizzes, so we can get that with the array, which

117
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,000
is quiz data and then the length.

118
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:59,430
So it'll be like, you know, three out of four or whatever, and then just put questions and are each

119
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,110
to OK and then let's have a reload button.

120
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:15,080
So round the two will have a button and we'll just do an in line on click here and set that to location

121
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,260
reload.

122
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:22,970
Which will just reload the page and it will start over and he'll say reload.

123
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:36,690
So let's save it, let's try it out, I'm just going to reload this and let's go ahead and select JavaScript.

124
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,940
So what is Cezannes stand for?

125
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,780
I'm going to choose the wrong answer on purpose here, html.

126
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,460
Stand for choose the right answer JavaScript.

127
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,290
I'll choose the right answer and submit.

128
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:52,920
And you can see I answered correctly at three out of four questions.

129
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,690
Let's rephrase that.

130
00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:01,830
You answered three out of four questions correctly.

131
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:09,180
OK, and just to show you that the reload button works, I'm just going to choose a bunch of wrong answers

132
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,570
here.

133
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,730
And if I click reload, it starts the quiz over.

134
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,320
All right.

135
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,420
So very simple little application.

136
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,180
Obviously, you could add much more to this.

137
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:22,940
And if you wanted to add more questions, all you would do is add to this array, OK?

138
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,320
And you could have these questions coming from some kind of database, coming from some kind of API.

139
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,660
But that's it.

140
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,470
Let's go ahead and move on to the next one.
