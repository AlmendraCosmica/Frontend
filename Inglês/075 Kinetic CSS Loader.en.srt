1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,030
OK, so this is going to be probably one of the shortest, if not the shortest project in this course,

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:08,370
but we're going to do a couple of cool things with success.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,870
So let's change the title here in our project starter to Connecticut, Connecticut loader, and we're

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,220
going to have in our HTML.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,320
Here is a class of kinetic div with a class of like and that's it.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,780
So in our stylesheet here, we don't need to bring in a font because we have no text so we can get rid

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,580
of this font family here.

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,500
I am going to add a background color.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:43,650
Let's say background color and we're going to set that to hexadecimal value of two three three five

10
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,500
zero, which will give us this blue background.

11
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,460
And we want to display Fleck's the correct the direction.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,880
I'm going to get rid of the column direction and justify and align to the center.

13
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:04,260
And then let's do the kinetic class, which I'm going to position this.

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:11,790
I want to position this relative because we're actually going to use the before and after pseudo selectors

15
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,150
to create our triangles and we want to position those absolute within this class.

16
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,730
So this has to be relative.

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:23,100
When you position something absolute and you want an inside of a specific container like this, the

18
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:30,780
container needs to be relative and then we're going to set the height and the width to 80 pixels.

19
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,990
OK, that's all we need for the kinetic class.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,150
Now we want to do the before and after pseudo selector.

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:48,900
So let's say kinetic coal and coal and after and also kinetic colon colon before.

22
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,120
And we're using both because we're going to have two triangles.

23
00:01:53,550 --> 00:02:00,390
So when you use before and after or before or after, you have to add this content property, which

24
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:02,070
we're just going to set to an empty string.

25
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,020
We're not actually inserting anything here.

26
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,760
And then we want this to be positioned absolute inside of this relative container.

27
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,920
And then for the position we'll do top zero left zero.

28
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,590
And we want to create a triangle now.

29
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:27,240
And CSFs, what you can do is create a basically a box with a height and a width of zero, which will

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:27,900
set here.

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,390
And then you can set a border to and set whatever with you want.

32
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,200
The bigger the width, the bigger the triangle.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,570
Let's do 50 pixels solid and we want to make this transparent.

34
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,970
OK, so we're not going to be able to see anything just yet.

35
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:44,190
But what we'll do is on the bottom.

36
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,040
So we'll say border bottom dash color and we're going to set that to white.

37
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,720
As soon as I do that, I see we get a triangle because essentially we have our border bottom, which

38
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,100
is white, but the left one, the left, right and top are transparent.

39
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,010
They're they're they're just transparent.

40
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:08,490
So if I wanted this to be facing down, I could set this to top color white or I could set top and bottom

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,790
to white and give it kind of an hourglass effect.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,630
So it's just just something cool you can do with access.

43
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,250
I just want this to be bottom, though.

44
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,150
All right.

45
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,190
And there's two triangles here on both of these on on before and after.

46
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:25,080
They're just positioned in the same place.

47
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,540
So we can it just seems like there's one.

48
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,570
Now we want to add an animation, a rotation animation.

49
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,640
So let's set.

50
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,870
Actually, before we do that, let's grab just the before, because the styles of bovver for both before

51
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:49,410
and after, we want to rotate before so that it's on over here on this side so we can rotate with the

52
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:50,910
transform property.

53
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,030
So let's say transform and then rotate.

54
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,240
And I want to rotate this 90 degrees.

55
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,980
And that's just the before one, which now is over here.

56
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,050
OK, so we have the before and after triangles.

57
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,230
Now for the animation, we're going to use keyframes.

58
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:18,360
So let's say keyframes will call this rotate a and for the I guess the time frames here will say zero

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,290
percent, 25 percent.

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,200
I just want to change.

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,460
I want to add the transform here for the rotate and set that to zero.

62
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,000
So it's going to start zero zero degrees.

63
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,750
All right.

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,680
So we can start there.

65
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:46,260
And then for 50 percent and 75 percent, let's set the transform rotates and we're going to set this

66
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,390
to 180 degrees.

67
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,910
And then for one hundred percent are up to 100 percent.

68
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,520
We're going to rotate all the way.

69
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,750
We don't want to do that.

70
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:04,400
We want to do transform and then rotate.

71
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,800
And this is going to be 360 degrees.

72
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,570
All right, let's put our semicolons here.

73
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:23,570
All right, so I want to apply this to this here to the before and after, so we apply a keyframe animation

74
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:31,490
with the animation property and let's say rotate a we want the duration to be two seconds.

75
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,510
It's going to be in a linear fashion.

76
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,530
It's going to be infinite.

77
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:40,180
So it's going to keep going and then a delay of zero point five seconds.

78
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,560
So that's what it's going to do for now.

79
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,440
And we also want to add a different rotation on the before.

80
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,080
So I'm going to copy this whole thing here.

81
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,270
OK, and basically what's happening is, you know, it starts at zero four, rotate A and then it goes

82
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:05,820
to 180, so goes from here to here and then 360.

83
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,910
So just does a complete circle.

84
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:16,330
And then for this one, this is going to be rotate B and I just want to add different values as far

85
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,940
as, you know, how far we're rotating.

86
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:28,660
So let's do 90 degrees for the first one and then this one is going to be to 70 degrees and then this

87
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,380
one is going to be 450 degrees.

88
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,330
And we want to apply rotate be to this before selecter.

89
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:50,160
So let's say animation and we want to apply rotate B and make it two seconds, linear and infinite.

90
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:51,320
All right.

91
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:57,460
And you might have to reload to because since we're using live server and it should look like this.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,600
So basically one triangle follows the other and you can experiment with it if you want, change up the

93
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,310
rotations and stuff like that.

94
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,770
But that's going to be it for this project.

95
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,080
I know this was a short one, but you could use this as a loader for your website or whatever.

96
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,610
I think it looks pretty cool and it gives you a little bit of experience with some animation and how

97
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,090
to create triangles and sixths or arrows, whatever you want to call them.

98
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,240
All right, that's it.

99
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,880
Let's move on to the next project.
