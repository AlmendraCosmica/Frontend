1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,890
OK, so now we want to start the JavaScript for this project right now, when this progress bar hits

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:07,200
the end, it just starts over and nothing changes.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,240
It's not dynamic.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:10,310
So that's where JavaScript comes in.

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,440
So let's start off by just grabbing everything we need.

6
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,960
We want the testimonials and testimonials container.

7
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:33,570
So I'm just going to use document dot, query selector and we have a class of testimonials container.

8
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:34,680
So we'll grab that.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,880
Let's grab the testimonial itself, which is the text.

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,870
So we want the class of testimonial that and then we want the image.

11
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:56,940
So we'll call this user image and that has a class of user dash image.

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:03,600
And we also want the user name that has a class of user name, because this is all stuff that we need

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,470
to SWAPO.

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,360
So user name.

15
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,100
And then finally we want the role.

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,960
So class of role and change that to roll.

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,290
All right.

18
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,760
So we're grabbing everything that we need from the DOM.

19
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,770
Let's actually just make this a little bigger.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,480
OK, so once we do that, we need to have our testimonial stored somewhere.

21
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:30,840
Now we're just going to have them right in an array.

22
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,490
So let's call this testimonials we don't have.

23
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:36,870
Yes.

24
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,550
So we don't have testimonials up here.

25
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,380
I call the testimonials container.

26
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,530
So this is just going to be an array which I'm going to grab and paste in.

27
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,740
Now, ultimately, you could have this stuff coming from a database.

28
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,780
You could just make a, you know, a simple fetch request if you had some kind of back end API that

29
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,280
served this Jason data.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,400
But for us, we're just going to have it right in here.

31
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,970
And I mean, that might be something you want to move on and do yourself in a lot of these projects.

32
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:08,220
I would suggest trying to add on to them, make them better, make them your own.

33
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,480
So we have these testimonials.

34
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,940
I'm going to define a variable for our index and that's going to start at one.

35
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:23,020
And then what we'll do is create a function to update the testimonial, because that's what we want

36
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:30,940
to do essentially is we want to update this data, this text, the user, the image and so on.

37
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:39,850
So what we'll do here is get from so we have this testimonials array and we can access if we have,

38
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,910
like, you know, testimonials one.

39
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:52,200
I'm just going to console log this for now and go down here and I'm just going to call, update, testimonial.

40
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:59,220
And if we go over here and we check out our console and see we have an object with Junn Char.

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,240
So if we go up here, you'll see Junn Char is the second one.

42
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,290
All right, because arrays are zero based.

43
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,030
So we have June char.

44
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:18,100
And obviously, if we put like two, we're going to get the next user, which is this Iida A. Niskanen?

45
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:18,880
I don't know.

46
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,620
Floren chooses some weird names.

47
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:25,260
So that's testimonials to which is the third position.

48
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,130
So what I want to do is just pass in here the index.

49
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,710
And I want to take from that.

50
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,160
I'm going to use just d structuring to pull out the fields because I don't want to have to say testimonials,

51
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,290
dot, index, dot, you know, dot name or whatever.

52
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,640
So we have these fields here, name, position, photo and text.

53
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:56,680
So what I'll do is say Consed and then with some curly brackets here, I want to pull from that item,

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:07,390
I want to pull the name, the position, the photo and the text from whatever the current testimonial

55
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:09,760
is using this index.

56
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,120
And then let's take testimonial.

57
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,380
So testimonial is going to be the paragraph that I brought in up above.

58
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,900
So bring that in and I'm going to set the inner HTML equal to the text of the current testimonial,

59
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,250
OK?

60
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,040
And then we're going to take the image.

61
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,630
So what does I call that.

62
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,310
So user image, we want to set that.

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,790
So let's say user image and we want to set the source.

64
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:46,060
We're going to say user image source equals the photo that we pull from the current testimonial.

65
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:53,290
Then we want to take the user name and we want to set that in our HTML and we're going to set that to

66
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,080
whatever the name is of the current testimonial.

67
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:04,840
And then finally, the role of the role set the inner HTML and we're going to set that to the position.

68
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,050
So the role is the same as the position.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,790
The user name is the same as the name that we just use different classes in the in the HTML.

70
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,880
So now after we do that, after we set all that, we want to take that current index and increment it

71
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,540
by one.

72
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,450
So just index plus plus.

73
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,530
Now if we get to the end, we want to start over.

74
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,910
We want to go back to the first testimonial.

75
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,860
So let's create an if statement here.

76
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:43,330
And let's say if the if the index is greater than the testimonials dot Langguth.

77
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:50,090
So the entire length of the array and I believe we have seven of these total seven testimonials.

78
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,450
So the last one is going to be the six position.

79
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,050
So we want to say testimonials length minus one.

80
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:03,130
If index is greater than that, then we're just going to set index to zero and I'm setting index to

81
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,750
one initially up here because the first one is already in the HTML here.

82
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,810
OK, so that's going to show first and then as soon as the ten seconds pass, when that progress bar

83
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,270
is up, we want to call, update, testimonial.

84
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,620
So back in the JavaScript we have the function call right here.

85
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,580
But what we want to do is.

86
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:29,340
This into a set interval, because we want this to be called every 10 seconds, so set in Deyrolle takes

87
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:35,460
in a function which in this case is going to be our update testimonial and then the amount of milliseconds

88
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,570
that we want to call this.

89
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:41,160
So 10000 milliseconds, which is going to be 10 seconds.

90
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,940
And it's very important that this matches.

91
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,800
This right here.

92
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,660
So if you want this to be shorter, if you want it to be five seconds, just change this to five seconds,

93
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,520
change this to five thousand.

94
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,050
OK, so let's save that.

95
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,680
Let's see what happens.

96
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,010
So as soon as this hits the end, it should all this content should change.

97
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,640
OK, there he goes.

98
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,590
Now you can see the text changed, the user image, the user name and the role have all changed because

99
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,920
we assign them to whatever the current index is.

100
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:23,810
And you could do things like change the background color or something like that as well.

101
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,150
And like I said, you could pull this data instead of having just a static array.

102
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,100
You could pull it from a database or pull it from some kind of API.

103
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,590
So there's a lot you could do here.

104
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:38,720
This is basically just the, you know, the front facing user interface.

105
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,110
But but that's going to be it for now, guys.

106
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,150
Hopefully you enjoyed this project and I'll see you in the next one.
