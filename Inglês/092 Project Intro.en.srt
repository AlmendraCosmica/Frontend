1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,040
So in this project, we're going to create this, we're going to have this image here and you can see

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,860
it says double click on the image to heart it and it says you liked it zero times.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,100
So when we click anywhere on this image, if I double click, you're going to see a heart pop up.

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,980
It's going to have a little CSFs Growe animation and it's going to show wherever we click.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,950
Not only that, it's going to show how many times we clicked.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,440
You can see you've clicked four times.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:28,350
So the HTML and access for this is really, really easy.

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:35,340
When we get into the JavaScript, we're going to set a double click event and basically insert a heart

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,710
in the exact position where we click.

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,230
So we're going to be working with, you know, the on the event parameter we have are the event object.

11
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:51,390
We have the client X and client Y values the the event target offset left offset top so we can tell

12
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,820
exactly where this element comes in from the top and the left, because we need to calculate, calculate

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,050
that in in order to find the exact position in the image.

14
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:05,220
And another thing we'll do is instead of just using DB, I'll click the double click event.

15
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,850
We're going to use just a single click event and basically create our own double click event based on

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,550
the time between space, between clicks.

17
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:20,160
So if I just click once and then I wait, you know, a decent amount of time again, that's not going

18
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:20,990
to be a double click.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,340
So we're going to test the time between clicks and basically create our own double click event.

20
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,030
All right.

21
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,870
So let's get into it.
