1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,970
All right, so we need to finish up our success, we have to deal with the actual NAV down here, but

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,790
before we do that, I'm just going to add a couple more content styles.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:23,250
So for for the content itself, let's do a max width of 1000 pixels and we'll set margin.

4
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,310
Let's do 50 pixels on the top and bottom.

5
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,640
Auto on the left and right.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,770
Keep it in the middle.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,980
So even if we stretch it out, you know, it's going to have a thousand pixel thousand pixel with Max.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:43,350
And then for the one sided content, each one of those is going to take the margin away from that.

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,730
So margin zero.

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,400
And then for the small tag for the author,

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:58,350
let's set a color of five five five and let's set a font style of italic.

12
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,140
And then for the paragraphs.

13
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,010
So content paragraph, we're going to set color to three, three, three.

14
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:13,080
And let's set let's increase the line height to one point five.

15
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:18,360
And we already have the image at 100 percent with good.

16
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:23,950
So now we just need to really deal with the navigation, which is right now is down here.

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,380
And what I want to do, since we're only going to see this when this actually rotates, when we click

18
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,170
this, I'm going to add the show now.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,450
So show dash nav.

20
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:40,050
I'm going to manually add it for now and then the actual navigation.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,930
We want that to be positioned over here.

22
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:43,590
Right.

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,010
So let's let's do this above where we did the content stuff.

24
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,190
And I'm just going to use the nav tag as a selector.

25
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:56,370
And I want to position this to be fixed because we want it fixed down to the bottom.

26
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:03,770
So we'll say fix and bring it from the bottom 40 pixels up and from the left zero.

27
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,700
So that puts it, you know, near where we're actually going to want it.

28
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,110
And then I'm just going to set a high Z index here.

29
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,500
So it's on top.

30
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:23,310
Let's do a Z index of one hundred and then for the you'll say nav unordered list.

31
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,350
I'm not class just now.

32
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:36,370
So for that, let's do a margin, not a margin, let's do a lifestyle type of nun, so that will get

33
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:43,780
rid of those bullet points and then I'm going to set patting left to 30 pixels and then we want to style

34
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,950
the list items.

35
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,800
So NAV, you'll ally.

36
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:58,780
And I want them all uppercase, so let's do a text, transform uppercase, and let's change that color

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,930
to whites.

38
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:08,690
And let's set a margin of 40 pixels on the top and bottom, so we're really going to separate them from

39
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:12,200
each other and then let's.

40
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,330
Let's bring it over here.

41
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,350
We need to have it initially over here.

42
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:23,790
More to the left, because it's going to come in as this rotates or right after rotates.

43
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:30,360
So to do that, we can use transform and we want to translate on the X axis.

44
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,340
So translate X, we want to bring it left.

45
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,970
So that would be negative.

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,750
Will do negative 100 percent.

47
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,150
So if I save that now, you can see that it's, you know, it's way over here.

48
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,340
We can still see it a little bit.

49
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:47,820
That's fine.

50
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,810
It's just going to come in.

51
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,990
But we want that to come in smoothly.

52
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,440
So let's add a transition on that.

53
00:03:54,450 --> 00:04:05,700
So transition the transform property and we'll do a zero point four second duration and we'll use these

54
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,450
in here.

55
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:17,370
And then let's see for the you know, let's comment this out for a minute just so we can actually see

56
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:17,700
this.

57
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,270
I want the this or some more space between the icon.

58
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,220
So let's do nav u l l i.

59
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:39,450
Well, I am going to set the font size, do 20 pixels and let's set margin right to 10 pixels.

60
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,930
OK, so makes the icon a little bigger, also put some space in between them.

61
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,200
Now.

62
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:58,300
We're going to want each with each one of these to stick out a little more, kind of going at an angle,

63
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:07,850
so what we can do is take the nav, let's say NAV, Ueli and then the direct ally after that.

64
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,470
And let's add a margin left of 15 pixels.

65
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:21,080
So if I save that, what happens is the allies after the initial lie are going to stick out 15 pixels.

66
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,130
Now, I want this last one to stick out even more.

67
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,730
So what I'll do is take this, copy it.

68
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,250
And let's say Elai, plus Elai plus elai.

69
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,920
So basically, anything after, you know, this one here, so the contact when I want to stick out,

70
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:48,390
double that of 30 pixels, now you can see that it's at an angle kind of at the same angle as the pages

71
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,690
here.

72
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:57,990
So we have an initially we have this negative 100 percent translate X.

73
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:04,110
So if I can comment that it goes almost off the screen, but we're going to want these ones to initially

74
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:06,840
start out more over as well to the left.

75
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,700
So I'm going to copy that.

76
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,110
And for this one, here we have our our margin left 15.

77
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,920
Let's do negative 150 percent.

78
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:22,170
And then for this one here, let's add let's do negative two hundred percent because we need those to

79
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,490
be over more.

80
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:28,980
Now, when we have the show NAV applied, we wanted to actually show the navigation.

81
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,780
Everything we just did is the default.

82
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:36,480
When you first come to the page, when this class is actually there, which it is now, because we manually

83
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,870
added it, we want to see all the navigation stuff.

84
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,150
So let's go.

85
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:51,600
We want to do this, we'll go right above the nav here and let's say so, the Container d'Hiv, when

86
00:06:51,600 --> 00:07:02,760
it has show Dasch NAV, then we want to take the direct navigation allies after that and we want to

87
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,810
bring them into view.

88
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:11,130
So let's set transform translate acts on all of those to zero, which is going to bring it to its,

89
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,540
you know, its original place.

90
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,640
And I want to add a little bit of a delay.

91
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,940
So we'll say transition delay.

92
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:26,250
Spell that right, transition delay, I'm going to set that to zero point three seconds so that it comes

93
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,940
in, you know, a little bit after I forgot my semicolon.

94
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,010
So it comes in a little bit after the rotation.

95
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,830
So now we're able to see it because we have that show NAV.

96
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:49,050
So if we take this off, then we just have, you know, just looks normal and then if we have it, you

97
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:54,430
can see it rotates and shows the the navigation.

98
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,920
Now we want to have the functionality where we click this.

99
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,260
Then it adds that class, which is going to be pretty easy.

100
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:09,060
So let's jump into our script here and let's create a variable called Open and we'll use documents dot

101
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,630
get element by D we have an idea of open.

102
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,450
We also have an idea of close.

103
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:25,860
So close, and then we also want to grab the container so consed container

104
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,730
kit element bidi actually no that's a that's a class.

105
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:41,530
So let's do I mean you could add an ID or you could just use Querrey selector and we want dot container.

106
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,370
It's a class.

107
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:42,720
All right.

108
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,040
So let's take open and let's add an event listener to that.

109
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:58,020
So we want to listen for a click, and when that happens, we're going to run a narrow function and

110
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:07,320
then we just want to take the container and from the class list, we want to add the class of the show.

111
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,850
Dasch now and then close is going to be similar.

112
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,270
So I'm someone's going to copy that.

113
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:20,190
And let's change this to close and then let's do container class list remove.

114
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:22,660
All right.

115
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:28,890
So I save that and I click, OK, so that happens.

116
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:37,980
So let me just reload, so I click and that rotates these shoot in, but we can't see the the close

117
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,340
here.

118
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:44,070
So to handle that, let's go back to our success.

119
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,240
And we basically just want the circle this to rotate when there's that show now of class.

120
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:56,610
So I'll go right below the circle.

121
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,540
So it's a circle and

122
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,580
dot show nav

123
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,820
and then we're not actually style I'm sorry, not circle container.

124
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,360
So when the container has shown that I've applied to it, then we want to style the circle.

125
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,340
And what we want to do with the circle is rotate it.

126
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,430
So let's say transform, rotate and we're going to rotate it negative 70 degrees.

127
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:37,050
OK, so now once it rotates, we can see the close button just because of where it's positioned.

128
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,020
When this circle rotates, it just comes into view.

129
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:41,840
All right.

130
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,290
So that looks pretty good.

131
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,840
So not too bad.

132
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,200
I mean, we're just adding or removing a class and we're setting certain certain styles on the circle

133
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,580
and on the navigation, you know, when we have that class applied.

134
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,520
So you could use this on with any website, any application.

135
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,540
So that's it.

136
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,160
Let's go on to the next video.

137
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,880
Next project.
