1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,070
OK, so now we're going to get into the JavaScript and basically we want to be able to double click

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,530
on any area on the image and have the heart appear.

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,340
We basically want to insert the heart icon into the dorm and we already have the keys for it to grow

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,480
and have that effect.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,490
So let's start off by bringing in the Love Me class.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:27,690
So you just document dot query selector and we're going to bring in the class of love me.

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,610
And then we also want the times, which I believe has an idea of time.

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,560
So that's going to be this zero right here, because we want to change that when we double click.

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:38,730
All right.

10
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,470
Now we'll take that love me class here that love me variable.

11
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:47,160
And we want to add an event listener and I want to double click now.

12
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,840
There's an easy way to do this.

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,850
We can pass and double click.

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,920
And then when we double click, we're going to fire off function.

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,650
And let's just do a console log of one, two, three.

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,260
So we'll go over here and open up our console.

17
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:01,880
Sure.

18
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:02,550
Save this.

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,000
And if I double click, we see one, two, three gets logged.

20
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,150
Now, we're going to make this a little more complicated.

21
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,360
And instead of just using double click, I want to use a single click, but create our own double click.

22
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:21,450
And if you want to pause the video and try to do this yourself, basically we're just going to test

23
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,070
the time between clicks.

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,680
And if it's less than a certain amount like let's say eight hundred milliseconds, then that's going

25
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,030
to be considered a double click.

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,560
If it's if it's, you know, the time range is wider between clicks, then that's not going to be a

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,150
double click.

28
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,470
So if you want to try that yourself, you can.

29
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:43,680
But I'm going to go ahead and just create a variable up here called click time.

30
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:57,030
And down here, let's check to see if the time is equal to zero, so quick time is equal to zero, then

31
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,230
we're going to set the clock time to new.

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,640
We're going to use the date constructor and the get time method here.

33
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,850
So we're going to set that and then I'll just go ahead and cancel log click time so you can see what

34
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,500
that gives us.

35
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,640
So if I go over here and I just click once, I'm going to see the value of click time, which had the

36
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,260
current time when I clicked.

37
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,170
And it's not going to work again because it's in this if statement.

38
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,690
Time is no longer equal to zero, so that's not going to work.

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:26,630
All right.

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,690
So we want to do that.

41
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:36,870
And then else so if it's not equal to zero, then we want to do another test here and check to see if

42
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:45,780
the let's actually let's let's put this in parentheses, another set of parentheses and let's say if

43
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,530
the new dates don't get time, so we're just checking the current timestamp.

44
00:02:51,750 --> 00:03:02,010
So if that is or if that minus the click time, I should say, if that is greater than 800 milliseconds,

45
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,370
then for now, let's just console log one, two, three else.

46
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:16,490
So if it's not less than 800, then we're going to just reset the clock time to zero.

47
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,620
I'm sorry, not zero the current day time.

48
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:26,570
So new date does get time, OK?

49
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,100
Now, if I go over here and I double click, I see one, two, three by single click.

50
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,850
Nothing happens if I single click and then I wait and single click.

51
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,980
That's not considered a double click because that is, that's greater than 800 milliseconds.

52
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:48,150
So if I do a quick that's less than 800 milliseconds and that gives me my double click functionality.

53
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,780
OK, so I mean you could use double as an event, but just to make it a little more fun, we just added

54
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,610
a click and then created our own double click event.

55
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,070
All right.

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,050
So when this happens, when we actually double click what we want to do, we're going to create our

57
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:11,460
call, I should say, a function called create heart, and we're going to pass the event parameter into

58
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,820
that.

59
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,710
And then because we need to map where the mouse is in the image, because that's where we want the heart

60
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,340
to appear.

61
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,590
We also want to set the click time.

62
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,600
We want to set that back to zero.

63
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,380
OK, so if I double click, it's going to tell me create heart is not a function or it's not defined.

64
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,090
So let's go ahead and define it down here.

65
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,200
It's a function create heart.

66
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,000
This is going to take in the event value here actually will make this let's make this an arrow function

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,330
so const create hearts and set that to an arrow.

68
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:55,920
So let's build a heart icon so we'll create a variable called heart and set that to document create

69
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,400
element.

70
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,100
So create element does just that.

71
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:07,770
We can create a div or any kind of html tag or each element I can use and I tag here and I want to add

72
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,060
a couple of classes to it.

73
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,950
So let's say heart dot class list dot add.

74
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,870
So remember with font awesome.

75
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:24,120
We have the first class and then I also want to add the a dash heart class.

76
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:34,230
OK, so now we have this heart element but we want to insert this wherever we're clicking now with this

77
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:41,130
event that's passed in here, ultimately coming from here from the the click event here, we can get

78
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,970
the position.

79
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,020
So let's say CONSED and we'll call this X.

80
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,790
So this is on the X axis.

81
00:05:48,150 --> 00:06:01,380
So on this event object, we have clients client X and then let's do call this Y and let's do client

82
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:07,020
Y, and then I just want to show you the values for this so we're going to can't type, we're going

83
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:15,240
to just cancel log X and Y now I'm going to go over here and click somewhere and I get one twenty two,

84
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,140
one thirty three.

85
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:21,330
If I go up in the corner here I get a ninety nine, I go over here.

86
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,940
So three seventy seven.

87
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,340
So the first value is on the x axis.

88
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,550
I'm way over here so the X value is three seventy seven.

89
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,520
I'm pretty close to the top so it's ninety two here.

90
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,480
It's eighty seven.

91
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,810
And this is just in you know in the viewport here.

92
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,480
So if I go way over here and I click you can see eighty five.

93
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,560
All right.

94
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,680
So it gives me the exact.

95
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,180
Coordinates of where I'm clicking, which is what I want.

96
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:55,360
Now, another value or two values that I want to get are the offset left in offset right values.

97
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:01,870
So the this E that is getting passed in here pertains to this element, right?

98
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,980
That the whole image.

99
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:10,000
So we want to get the offset from the left and we want to get the offset from the right so that we can

100
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:18,520
basically we can subtract that from whatever these x y values are, because we wanted to show, you

101
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:24,010
know, within this image here that this is this is our our working space, not the entire viewport.

102
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:27,610
So we want to subtract this and this from wherever we're clicking.

103
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,260
All right.

104
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:34,840
And on that event parameter, on that e value, we can use offset left and offset top.

105
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:46,270
So let's say const and let's set left offsets and set that to E and this is actually on the target property.

106
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:54,100
So idot target, dot offset or I'm sorry, left offset and then we want the top as well.

107
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:59,990
So this one is going to be top offset and top offset.

108
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,030
OK, so now we want to basically take our X and Y values, which is in the place in the viewport that

109
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:10,650
we click and we want to subtract left and top from those.

110
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:20,910
So let's say const X inside, so inside the image and set that to X what we want to minus the left offset.

111
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:27,310
OK, we're going to do the same thing with Y and we're going to minus the top offset because X is right

112
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,890
and left wise up and down.

113
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,800
So this is going to be Y inside.

114
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,450
OK, now you can get rid of this console log.

115
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:44,760
Actually let's console log just to see what we get for X inside and Y inside, so we'll save that.

116
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,930
And now if I click way end up in this corner.

117
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,780
OK, so I'm getting not a number.

118
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,110
OK, so I screwed this up.

119
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,140
This shouldn't be.

120
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,760
It's not left offset.

121
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,260
It's offset left.

122
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,940
So offset left, I must adjust that the autocomplete.

123
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,710
So this is offset top.

124
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,100
All right.

125
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,750
So let's save that now and let's go up into this corner.

126
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,970
And now you'll see that these values are relative to the image rather than the viewport.

127
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:15,880
Before it was like, what, eighty five or something like that.

128
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:19,900
But now so that's two one and that's one one.

129
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,530
OK, so that's the start of the corner here.

130
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,920
So that gives us the correct coordinates within the image, not the viewport.

131
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:33,100
So now that we have those values, what we'll do is take the heart that we created.

132
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:42,130
We created that element and we want to set the style top property now in the success for the Love Me

133
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:42,550
heart.

134
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:48,820
Remember, we positioned that absolu so we can use top left, bottom right CSFs properties, but we

135
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,960
don't want to set them here.

136
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,510
We don't want a hard code them because it's dynamic.

137
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,460
It's going to be wherever it's set here.

138
00:09:54,730 --> 00:10:01,930
So I'm going to set the top value and I'm going to set that to let's actually just put a template literal

139
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,670
in here and we want to set it to Y inside.

140
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,060
Remember, this is the top, so we want the Y axis, which is top and bottom, and then we just want

141
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,910
to add pixels and then we want to do the same here.

142
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:21,610
This will be X inside and here we're going to set the left property.

143
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:24,610
OK, so we're going to insert it there.

144
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,010
Now, it's not going to show up just yet.

145
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:34,000
So if I double click, it's not going to do anything because we need to add it to the love me element

146
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,250
we want to append child.

147
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,490
OK, so we're adding it in the love me element.

148
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,210
The heart.

149
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,060
All right.

150
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,310
So if I go ahead and I click now, there we go.

151
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,990
So we're inserting that heart wherever we click in the image.

152
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:56,260
So even though this is a very, very simple project in terms of like functionality, if you didn't know

153
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,500
that you can get the positioning of the mouse and stuff and then how to get the exact position within

154
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,660
inner element, this can be very helpful for many other, you know, larger projects.

155
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,710
So we're not done yet.

156
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,470
We want to do this time thing.

157
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,910
And this is going to be pretty easy.

158
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,270
We're just going to initialize another variable up here.

159
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,220
We'll call this times collect and set that to zero by default.

160
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,410
And we already brought the Times element in which is a span right here with the idea of times.

161
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:34,540
So we'll say times dot in our HTML and set that two times clicked, but that's going to be zero.

162
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,820
So we would just want to increment it and we can do that by just adding a plus plus at the beginning

163
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,570
and that will increment it by one.

164
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,780
So now if we go over here and I double click, you'll see you liked it one times to three.

165
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,810
And obviously it doesn't matter, you know, where we click.

166
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:56,950
Now, one thing I want to show you is in the elements tab, we see just kind of double click.

167
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,240
So this is going to put in the the eye tag here with the, you know, FASFA heart.

168
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,480
But look how many there are.

169
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:12,700
So basically, we're just we keep putting them in, but they don't they disappear because of this,

170
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,070
because we're setting the opacity to zero.

171
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,410
But they're all still there.

172
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,470
So to fix this, we want to remove each heart after, let's say, one second.

173
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:31,060
So we'll use a set time out here and this will just run a function after a certain amount of time.

174
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,010
So the second argument we pass in is that amount of time, which I'm going to do one second, which

175
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,420
is a thousand milliseconds.

176
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:43,150
And we don't even actually need curly braces because all we're doing is this heart hardcourt remove.

177
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:45,410
So we're just removing it from the dawn.

178
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:53,530
So now if we take a look at down here in So Love Me Right Now is empty, I'm going to double click and

179
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:57,280
now and you can see it gets filled in.

180
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,110
I can't even click it fast enough.

181
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,870
Actually, you know, what I'll do is just change this to five seconds.

182
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,980
So I'll click and you'll see the heart is in there.

183
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,040
After five seconds, it removes.

184
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,080
OK, but I want to set that to one second.

185
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,560
I just just slowed it down to show you.

186
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,270
So now it's not going to fill up with all these hearts.

187
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,340
They get removed after one second.

188
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:19,750
All right.

189
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,400
So that's pretty much it.

190
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,940
Hopefully you guys enjoyed this project and we'll move on to the next.
