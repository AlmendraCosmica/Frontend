1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,120
OK, guys, now we want to start on the JavaScript, which isn't a lot, actually, it's only about

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,310
about 20 lines or so, a little less.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,130
But I first want to just explain what we need to do with the background position.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,320
So ultimately, as I said before, all of these boxes are going to be inserted to the DOM via JavaScript.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,700
We're not going to have these hardcoded and we're also going to add a background position to each one.

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,940
Now, I'm going to do that manually just so you can see what the values are going to be.

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,980
So for this first one, we'll just go ahead and set a style here and set the background position.

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,590
So background position has an X and Y property for this first box.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,190
It's going to be zero zero, OK, which is the default.

10
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,400
So, I mean, it's not even going to change, but that's going to be the first one.

11
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,240
The next one.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,840
Let me just copy this right here, this whole style and put that.

13
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,230
And so this one here, let's let's think about where this needs to be.

14
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,400
So remember, these are one hundred and twenty five pixels with and height.

15
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,070
So for this one, we want part of the 125 pixels to be shifted this way.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:10,960
All right.

17
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:18,240
So with this background position as first value is the X value, so we want to go negative one twenty

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,590
five pixels.

19
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,160
And if I save that now you can see that it basically looks like it's connected.

20
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,500
In fact, if we get rid of this big class and we save it is connected.

21
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,570
So for the next one and if you guys want to take a second and think about what you should put here,

22
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,880
go ahead and do that.

23
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:44,070
So we did for the X value, for the second box, we said negative 125.

24
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,610
Now for this one here, we want to actually double that.

25
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,030
Right.

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:52,170
So instead of negative 125, because if I do that, it's going to just match this one.

27
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,390
We want to go over 125 more.

28
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,510
So we want to change this to 250 fifty.

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,840
OK, and now it looks like it's part of the image.

30
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,080
Like it's one big image for this one here, the fourth one.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,790
Let's go ahead and do negative three.

32
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,520
Seventy five and then we go.

33
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,730
So now we have our top row now four for this one here.

34
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,270
It's going to be a bit different because now we're dealing with both X and Y values.

35
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:24,650
So for that for this one, we're going to have and I'm going to get rid of this.

36
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,350
I'm just showing you what these are, what we need to do within the JavaScript.

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:34,560
But this is going to be zero on the X axis because it's it's the first one and it's going to be on the

38
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,640
Y axis.

39
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,940
We want to do negative four and twenty five because we want to bring it up.

40
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:44,130
OK, now the second one we need to bring over and up.

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,950
I should say that it's actually the six one we need to bring over.

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:57,120
And so what we would do is on the x axis one twenty five and then on the Y negative one twenty five.

43
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,710
There we go.

44
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,650
OK, and then we would just continue that, bringing in, bringing these up and over.

45
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,940
So what I'll do is just completely get rid of all the boxes.

46
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,170
OK, we just want to have the container here.

47
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,160
I just want to have this ID boxes, class boxes and then that's going to completely go away.

48
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,460
Now we're going to jump don't jump into our script and do this with JavaScript.

49
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:25,350
So first thing we need to do is bring in any elements that we need, such as the boxes container.

50
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,980
So we use that document object and we're going to use the method get element by D and we're going to

51
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,610
get the ID by the boxes ID.

52
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,780
And then we also want the button because we need to add an event listener to that.

53
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,440
So let's say const BTN and we'll use document element by day.

54
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,200
Believe it has an idea of B10.

55
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,070
OK, so we bring those in.

56
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:57,720
Now the way that I'm going to do this is we're going to do a function called create boxes and we want

57
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,670
to call that function and then inside create boxes.

58
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,670
We need to create four boxes for each row.

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,030
So four columns of four rows, four columns.

60
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,980
So the way we can do that is we can use two for loops.

61
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,220
OK, so let's say for and I'm not going explain what a for loop is.

62
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,810
It is expected that, you know, at least the fundamentals before taking this course.

63
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,460
So let's say let's I so we want to set it to zero.

64
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:36,450
And then the condition here is going to be if I is less than four and then we want to increment I by

65
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:36,900
one.

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,680
OK, now we have rows and columns here, so we want to put another for loop and we have to use something

67
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,640
different than I.

68
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,470
So let's do that.

69
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,350
J equals zero.

70
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:55,610
And then as long as J is less than four and then J plus plus increment it by one.

71
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:59,910
Now within here we want to construct those 16 boxes.

72
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:07,570
OK, so this is going to look through 16 times and we're going to create this with document and then

73
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:11,830
there's a method called Create Element and we want to create a div member.

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,930
So we're just creating these these divs here, that's all.

75
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:18,690
That's all we're doing right now.

76
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,670
And we can even go ahead and console log box.

77
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:31,250
And if we go over here and open our console, you see that we now have should be 16 divs.

78
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,830
Now, remember, they need to have the class of box.

79
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:40,390
So what we can do is take our box variable or box element, take the class list and call the add method.

80
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,730
And we want to add the class of box.

81
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,820
So if we save that now, we can see that over here in the console.

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,740
Now this is where we're going to do the positioning.

83
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:57,730
So to add a specific style, we can use DOT style and then whatever property we want.

84
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:59,950
And it has to be in Camil case, obviously.

85
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,920
So we want background position and we can't do background Dasch position, which is what we would do

86
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,580
in case we do it like this with Camil case.

87
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:16,630
So background position and the way we can set this to be dynamic is we can put some template literals

88
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:20,020
here so that we can use variables and expressions.

89
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:29,920
And remember, it's going to be something like, you know, negative one twenty one twenty five pixels

90
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,380
zero.

91
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,720
It's going to be something like this.

92
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,870
But of course this is going to be dynamic.

93
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,540
So what we can do is we can put a variable syntax.

94
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:43,270
So dollar sign and curly braces, we can put in a variable or an expression in here and we're going

95
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:52,630
to take negative J because remember it's going to be negative, negative 125, negative 250, etc..

96
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,210
So we want to take that and multiply it by 125.

97
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,740
So it'll loop through.

98
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,460
It'll be, you know, zero then negative 125, native to 50.

99
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,870
Negative three seventy five.

100
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,640
So that's the X value.

101
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:15,430
Now for the Y, we're going to go ahead and put another variable expression in here and use negative

102
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,560
eye and also multiply by one twenty five.

103
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:27,460
So this will do exactly what I did manually a few minutes ago, but it will add it through the JavaScript

104
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,300
dynamically with these calculations.

105
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,900
Now the last thing we want to do is not console log.

106
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,220
Let's get rid of that.

107
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:42,040
We want to take our box boxes container that we brought in earlier and we want to call Append Child

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,670
and we want to add in the box.

109
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:47,320
So if I go ahead and save, let's see.

110
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,790
Something's not right here.

111
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:59,930
Let's see, so we set the box start style background position to oh, I forgot pixels.

112
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:07,040
So right now it's just setting it to the numbers we need to actually add in after these pixels.

113
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:08,510
And there we go.

114
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,390
So right now we have the class.

115
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:19,230
Or I'm sorry, we don't have the class of big, so it's 500 pixels which squishes them all together

116
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,840
and there's no in between.

117
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:25,630
But if I add the class of big, it separates them, but it's still intact.

118
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,560
Now, we just want to add an event listener onto let's actually get rid of.

119
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,340
No, we'll keep the class there to start with.

120
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,150
But let's go back to our script and let's go up here.

121
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,960
Actually, we'll go and we'll do it right here.

122
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,250
So we'll take our button.

123
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:43,910
And we want to add an event listener.

124
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,870
So we want to listen for a specific event.

125
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:52,900
Now, this takes in the event we want, which is a click and then a function so we can either put a

126
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,920
function or we can use an arrow function like this.

127
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:03,570
OK, and we just want to we don't even need since this is only going to be one line of code, we don't

128
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:05,790
even need these curly braces.

129
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:16,440
So we'll just take the boxes container and take a class list and then toggle so it'll add and remove

130
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,870
the class of big.

131
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,770
So let's save that.

132
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,790
Let's go over here.

133
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,480
Let's click and there we go.

134
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,860
So we get that cool effect.

135
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:30,180
And just to show you, let me just make this bigger.

136
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,260
So we're just about done.

137
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,090
If I show you in the console, put this over here and we look at this class, right.

138
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,250
So you can see that the class of big is there.

139
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,650
If I click that, it adds and removes it.

140
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,270
And that's what causes that effect.

141
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,450
And we have that rotate in the success.

142
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:49,700
Right.

143
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:53,990
So right here, we have this rotate which is causing that to happen.

144
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,410
We also have a transition of point four seconds.

145
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:03,480
You can increase that if you want or decrease that if you want a different speed.

146
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,360
But yeah, so that's pretty much it.

147
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,330
All right.

148
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,430
So hopefully you enjoyed this little project.
