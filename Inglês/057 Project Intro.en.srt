1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:04,980
OK, so in this project, we're going to build an image slider, but we're also going to have the background

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,170
image change as well.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,190
And you can see the background is basically in line with this image here.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,330
So we're going to have some event listeners on these arrows and these buttons.

5
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:20,130
So when I click, it's going to change this image but also change the background image and position

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,720
it into the right place.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,490
So you'll see that these are basically connected, this foreground image in the background.

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,480
All right.

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,790
So with the both background images, just one is on this, the slide element and then one is on the

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,810
body element.

11
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,510
And we're going to add some JavaScript to to add these event listeners and have everything lined up

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:40,080
nicely.

13
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:40,800
All right.

14
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,870
So let's get started.
