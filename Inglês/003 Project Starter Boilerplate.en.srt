1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,670
OK, so I just want to create a project starter, basically a boiler plate that we can use in all the

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,480
following projects so we don't have to keep recreating files and so on.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,780
You can just duplicate this folder and rename it.

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,200
So I called it Underscore, Project, Underscore, Stotra Underscore.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,750
And the reason for the underscores is just because it's not an actual project, it's just the boilerplate.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,680
So this is completely empty.

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,540
There's nothing in it.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,250
And I'm going to open this with VX code.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,280
If you're on Windows, you can write, click and say open with code.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:34,860
If you're on a Mac, you can drag it down to your bar code icon and it should open and you can see it's

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,670
completely empty.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,440
So I'm going to create three files.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,390
Indexed HTML is the first one.

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,940
Then we want our stylesheet, which I'm going to call style dot access and then we want our JavaScript

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,240
file, which I'm going to call script Jass.

16
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,320
So these are the three main files that we're going to use in all of these projects.

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,690
Now in the HTML, I'm going to go ahead and use Emet and do exclamation enter and that's going to give

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:05,100
me just a boilerplate of an HTML page with the HTML five DOCTYPE head body tags and so on.

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,580
And I'm just going to go ahead and tab down to the title here and say my project and we can change this

20
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,660
for every project.

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,470
And then in the body we'll just have an H1 and we'll say project starter.

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,860
OK, now to open this, I'm going to save this now to open it, you could go to your the actual file

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,740
like, you know, go here and open indexed HTML, but we're going to be using live server.

24
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,760
So what we want to do is just write, click and say open with live server.

25
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,150
And you can see that it's open on my local hosts, Ray Lookback address, which is one two seven zero

26
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,480
zero one in Port 5500.

27
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:51,280
So I'm just going to make this smaller and we want to make sure that we include our stylesheet here

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,560
in our JavaScript.

29
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:59,800
So I'm just going to close the sidebar up and let's add here, we'll say link enter and for the traffic,

30
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:05,110
we want to link to our stylesheet and we want to link to the JavaScript down here right above the ending

31
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:08,200
body tag will say script colon SIRC.

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,260
And the source for this JavaScript is going to be script Gorgias.

33
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,770
OK, so now both of those should be included.

34
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:18,700
And that's pretty much all I want to have for the starting HTML.

35
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,540
Now, one thing I want to mention is in some projects will be using font.

36
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,020
Awesome.

37
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,850
So you have to include the font awesome style sheet and there's a couple of ways to do that.

38
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:35,920
So the first is to actually go to font awesome dot com and you can put your email address in here and

39
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,940
say send kit code and it'll give you a link to the font.

40
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,980
Awesome success.

41
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,130
Now we're not going to do that.

42
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:48,160
What I usually do is go to CDN, CDN, News.com and just search for font.

43
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,760
Awesome.

44
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,630
And you can just simply grab the link right here.

45
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,410
So this is the success that you need.

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,460
You can copy the link tag and you can put that right above your link to your stylesheet and then we

47
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,090
can use font.

48
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,480
Awesome.

49
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,630
So some projects I might start off with this link already here.

50
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,480
If you want, you can keep it here, just comment it out.

51
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:11,770
And then on projects where we use it, you can uncommented it whatever you want, but I'm just going

52
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,240
to go ahead and leave it out.

53
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,600
I just wanted to mention that now for our stylesheet.

54
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,240
I do want to start with a default font.

55
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,010
I want to start with the Raboteau font.

56
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,410
So I'm going to go ahead and just go to Google fonts real quick.

57
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,890
And I have it up here and a shortcut.

58
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,110
And Rebadow is right here.

59
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,220
If you don't see it, you can search for it and you can use a different font if you'd like.

60
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,280
But I'm going to use Raboteau regular 400.

61
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,660
So say Select the style and then Bould 700, select the style.

62
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,630
And over here you can either use a link in your HTML or an import in your success.

63
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,840
So I'm going to use the import.

64
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,340
I'm going to copy this.

65
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,650
I don't need the style tags, just the import.

66
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,080
And then we'll go back into our style sheet and just paste that in there.

67
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,980
That way we can use that font.

68
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,880
All right.

69
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,330
So we can close this up and let's apply that to the body.

70
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:11,830
So say Font Dasch family and set that to Raboteau sans serif.

71
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,650
So I save that notice that it auto reloads.

72
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,580
It's because we're using live server and I know a lot of you guys probably already know all of this

73
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,770
stuff, but I want to make sure that I'm clear because I know that there are beginners taking this course.

74
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:24,820
All right.

75
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,570
Now, I also want to set on the universal selector.

76
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,860
So an asterisk here.

77
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:32,290
This just means we want to apply this to everything.

78
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,780
I want to apply a box sizing property.

79
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,320
This is something I do in just about every project or access.

80
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,480
We want to set it to board a box so that if we add any padding or any border on to an element, it doesn't

81
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,860
actually affect the width of it.

82
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,470
So I add this on just about everything I do.

83
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,450
And then in the body here, I'm actually going to get rid of the margin.

84
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:58,450
So let's say margin zero, the space you see here is from the the actual H1.

85
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,390
And I'm also going to display Flex.

86
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,390
And the reason for this is because I want to center everything, because a lot of the most of the projects

87
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,210
are going to be something that's right in the middle of the viewport.

88
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:12,430
So I'm going to display Flex.

89
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,920
And just to talk a little bit about Flex Box, for those of you that haven't used it, I'm going to

90
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,590
put two more elements in here.

91
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,720
It could be anything, but I'm just going to put some twos and just setting it to display flex, it's

92
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,800
going to put it in a row.

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
You can see how everything I put in the body now goes this way, goes horizontal.

94
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,710
I don't actually want that.

95
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:40,180
I want it to go back vertical, but still be a flex box so we can set the flex direction to column if

96
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,990
I save that.

97
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,420
Now, you can see it goes back vertical.

98
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:50,560
Now, since this is a flex box, I can go ahead and use a line items and I want a line item center.

99
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:56,380
Now, if your flex box is a column like this is then a line items is going to pertain to aligning it

100
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,370
horizontally.

101
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,450
If it's a row, it would pertain to vertical.

102
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,240
All right.

103
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,760
So we we we centered it horizontally.

104
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,230
I also want to center it vertical.

105
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,490
I want it to be right in the middle.

106
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,650
So for that we can add justify content and set it to center.

107
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,670
Now, notice how it didn't move to the center here vertically, and that's because the body doesn't

108
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:16,660
have a height on it.

109
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,830
OK, we need our flex blocks to have a height, so let's set a min.

110
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:27,550
We'll just set height to 100 vate, which is a viewport height and that means take up the entire height

111
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,280
of the the browser, the viewport.

112
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,440
So I'm going to save and now you can see it's centered both ways.

113
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,630
OK, and then the last thing I want to add here is just an over.

114
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:36,220
Flow.

115
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:42,270
And I'm going to set it to hidden because I don't want scroll bars to be shown by default and that's

116
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,440
it.

117
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,590
So I'll just get rid of these two twos and just keep the one there.

118
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,110
OK, so that's pretty much it.

119
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,390
No JavaScript, because that's very, very, you know, very differently per project.

120
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:58,290
I just wanted to add some basic styling to kind of move everything to the middle out of font.

121
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:04,880
Also link in our style sheet and JavaScript because we don't want to do that in every single project.

122
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:11,910
So from now on, you can just simply copy or duplicate this folder and we can go ahead and get right

123
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,890
into the project.

124
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,600
Now, if you want to stop live server, you see this little port 5500, you can click that or you can

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,970
right click and you can say stop live server.

126
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,380
And now it's going to stop serving on that on localhost 5500.

127
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,230
OK, so that's going to be pretty much the workflow.

128
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:34,440
We'll go ahead and use this boilerplate here, the project starter and will use live server to run it

129
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,450
and then we'll go ahead and create our projects.
