1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,160
OK, so this is a pretty simple project, what we're going to do here is have a form.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:12,150
It's basically a login form and the length of the password is going to be detected.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,790
And this image, it's going to start off blurry.

4
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,130
And as the password gets longer and stronger, this is going to become more clear.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,340
So you'll see if I go ahead and enter one character, it gets a little more clear.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,220
Another another.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,500
And eventually it just ends up as a completely clear image.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,260
So it's a cool little way to test password strength.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,820
Now, this is obviously very simple.

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,950
It's only going by the password length.

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:45,030
You could add on to this after and you could, you know, see if there's special characters or uppercase

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,530
letters and numbers and all that.

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,960
But this is this is going to be pretty simple to begin with.

14
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,870
We're also going to be using the Tailwind CSFs framework and we're just using a CDN.

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,900
We're not going to, like, download it or compile it or anything like that.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,070
We're not using NPM.

17
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:05,010
We're just going to throw the CDN link in so we can use some of the classes and make the styling a little

18
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,950
easier on us.

19
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,270
All right.

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,490
So you'll get a little bit experience with some of the tail when utility classes in this project as

21
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:11,820
well.

22
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,960
OK, so let's begin.
