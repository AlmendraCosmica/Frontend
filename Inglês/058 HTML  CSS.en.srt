1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,670
OK, so we're going to get started on the HTML and access, I have my project starter open here, the

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:06,750
index HTML.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,780
I do have a link to font awesome because we'll be using a couple of icons for the buttons, the arrows.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:21,300
So down in the title here, let's get rid of that and change it to background slider and get rid of

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,660
this H1 here and we're going to have a wrapper container called slider dash container.

6
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:31,920
And in here we were going to have five divs with the class of slide.

7
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:36,760
And the first one, I'm also going to give a class of active that's going to represent the current image

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,800
or the active image.

9
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:38,730
All right.

10
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,200
So go ahead and do that.

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,300
And nothing is going to go in these devs.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,870
We're going to add in inline style for the background image.

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,110
So let's say background image and set that to you earlier.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,580
And then inside here, we're going to put a link to an image which I'm going to grab real quick.

15
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,190
And if you want these exact images, you can get them from the the final repository.

16
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,870
So that's all that these divs are going to be just a class of slide with a inline style background image.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,270
So I'm going to just grab and paste the the other four.

18
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,990
So this div ends here.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,400
You still want to be within the container and I'm going to paste these other four in and save so the

20
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,500
other four don't have the class of active.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,240
Only the first one should have the active class and then under all those divs but still in the container.

22
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,530
So right above the last div here we're going to have our buttons and this one is going to have a class

23
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:47,880
of arrow and the class of arrow dash left or left arrow and then also inside of left.

24
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,660
And the button itself is going to be a font awesome icon.

25
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:58,110
So I tag class of eFax and then f a dash arrow dash left.

26
00:01:58,750 --> 00:01:59,190
All right.

27
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:07,950
And then we'll go ahead and just copy that down and let's replace left here, here and here with right.

28
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,940
OK, and that should do it.

29
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:13,710
So I'm going to save and this is all we're going to see for now.

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:20,070
We don't see the background image because these divs have no content and we didn't set a height or width

31
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:21,240
on these div.

32
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,220
So we're not going to see the images just yet.

33
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:30,360
Now let's jump into our stylesheet and ultimately the background image is going to get generated through

34
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,260
the JavaScript.

35
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:42,060
But for now, I'm going to just just hard code a background image and I'm going to use the first image

36
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,150
from the HTML here from this first div.

37
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:49,890
I'm just going to grab that and we'll go ahead and put that in there.

38
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,410
And if I say we should now see that background image, I'm going to add some background properties.

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:04,680
So let's add the position to the background position will be center on both the X and Y axis and let's

40
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,700
add a background size and set that to cover.

41
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,870
And there we go.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Now, I'm also going to add a transition here because ultimately we're going to change images.

43
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:23,870
And I just want to have like kind of a little little slide effect or slide transition.

44
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:31,530
So on the on the body, let's add a zero point for second transition and we'll use the EAS effect.

45
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,160
And you can see when I save it kind of shows you that.

46
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,360
All right.

47
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:42,900
Now for the overlay, because we don't want this whole like we don't want this image to be this bright.

48
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:48,510
So for the overlay, I'm going to take the body and use the before pseudo selector.

49
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:55,830
And when we use before or after, we have to add content here, which we're not actually adding any

50
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,340
content.

51
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,660
So just leave that blank.

52
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,970
And what we're essentially doing is just putting an overlay over this image here.

53
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,870
So we want to position this to be absolute.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,500
It's going to be absolute and then from the top so top zero and left zero.

55
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,830
So we're just starting in the top left corner and then we want the width to be 100 percent and we want

56
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,010
the height to be 100 viewport height.

57
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:25,440
So we want to just take up the entire viewport.

58
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:34,320
And then for the background, the same background color, we're going to set that to be a and set it

59
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,440
to black and then let's do zero point seven for the for the Alpha, for the transparency.

60
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,660
Now you can see we have the overlay with the arrows are actually behind the overlay and we don't want

61
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:45,960
that.

62
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,910
So I'm going to set the Z index to negative one.

63
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,960
I'm going to set it lower.

64
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,330
So now that everything will be on top of the overlay.

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,350
So now let's go ahead and add.

66
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:09,590
The slider container styles, so we're going to have a box shadow here and we're going to have to shadows,

67
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:14,090
the first will do zero two zero three pixels.

68
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:23,630
So the horizontal and vertical offset and then the Blu will do six pixels and the color RGB A, which

69
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,890
is going to be black.

70
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:32,570
And for the alpha value, let's do zero point one six and then we'll put a comma here for the next shadow,

71
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:43,910
which will be zero three pixels, six pixels are GBA and zero zero zero and zero point two three.

72
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,910
And we can't see that yet because we don't have any content.

73
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,380
We also don't have a height or with.

74
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,760
So let's set a height here.

75
00:05:50,660 --> 00:06:00,710
We'll do 70 viewport heights and let's give this a width of 70 VW, which is viewport widths.

76
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,260
And now you can see the outline here.

77
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,850
You can see the box shadows.

78
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:13,670
And then I also want to just add position relative, because the slides are going to be positioned absolute

79
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:20,900
within the container and then also overflow hidden because we don't want anything going out of the container.

80
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,310
So we'll set that as well.

81
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:30,500
Now we have multiple divs with background images and each one has a class of slide, but only one should

82
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,870
have a class of active.

83
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:42,830
So I'm going to set slide initially, set the opacity to zero and then down here, let's say slide with

84
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:48,950
the class of active, then that's going to have an opacity one.

85
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,900
So we only see the first one.

86
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,820
OK, now this slide class, we have to add a bunch of other stuff here.

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,500
Remember, this has the background image on it.

88
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,080
It's just in line, so it's not in the style sheet.

89
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,940
So I do want to set well, you know what?

90
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,370
Let's do the heightened with first so that we can actually see the image.

91
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:15,290
So we'll do a height of one hundred viewport heights in a width of 100 viewport widths.

92
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,530
OK, so that obviously doesn't look right.

93
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,510
We want to add some background position.

94
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:33,650
So background position is going to be center center on both X and Y and let's do a background size of

95
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,620
cover and there we go.

96
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:47,810
Now, I do want to set the position of this to absolute and then I want to set from the top negative

97
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,100
15 pixels.

98
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,590
So it's going to move it up a little bit.

99
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:57,170
And then let's say from the left, negative are not fifteen pixels.

100
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:00,500
Fifteen vich like that.

101
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,050
And then the left is going to be negative.

102
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,580
Fifteen VW.

103
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,710
All right.

104
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:13,220
And then we're going to have a transition on this because these, these are going to be switched the

105
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,440
background images and we want a nice transition.

106
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,870
So let's do zero point four seconds.

107
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,870
And he used an EZ effect and just set the Z index to one.

108
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,580
So it's always on top.

109
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,590
Now for the Arrow.

110
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's go ahead and add that class here, and I'm going to position both both of the buttons of the class

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,190
of our I'm going to position them to be fixed and then to see them just tempora, because ultimately

112
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,950
they're going to be like, you know, over here and over here.

113
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,560
But right now they're behind this.

114
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,430
So and this slide has a Z index of one.

115
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,920
So let's set the Z index of this just temporarily.

116
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm going to set it to 100.

117
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:07,790
So now that we can see them and since we position them fixed, they're basically both in the same spot.

118
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,350
But we'll fix that.

119
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,150
Let's just add some style to them.

120
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:18,710
So we'll add a background, let's say background color transparent.

121
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:30,480
OK, and now let's make the actual side some padding there, so padding will do 20 pixels kind of break

122
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,430
it up a little bit, let's put the font size because remember, we're using font awesome icons.

123
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:38,310
So we're going to have the font size to 30 pixels.

124
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,710
And then let's set the I want to move it down.

125
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:51,840
Actually, before we do that, let's do the border, which I'm going to do two pixels solid and orange

126
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,890
for the color.

127
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:59,700
And then let's say from the top, let's go down 50 percent.

128
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,350
But we want to be in the exact middle.

129
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,660
We don't want just the top of it to be in the middle.

130
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,290
So the way we can do that is by adding a transformed property.

131
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,000
So transform and we want to set translate.

132
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,200
Why?

133
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:20,880
Because this is on the Y axis, which is the vertical axis, and we just want negative 50 percent,

134
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,080
which will move it up into the exact middle.

135
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,500
So the middle of this is now right in the middle.

136
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,560
Now for the let's see.

137
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,370
So we have a left arrow and a right arrow.

138
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:40,440
If we look back here, we have left arrow, left our right arrow.

139
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,440
So I'm going to position those.

140
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,470
So let's say a left arrow.

141
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,970
And remember, the arrows are positioned fixed.

142
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,950
I'm going to set the left position and pass in a calc value here.

143
00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:05,100
So this will calculate whatever I put in here, which is going to be 15 viewport widths, minus 65 pixels.

144
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,380
And if I save that, you can see that now this is over here, the left arrow.

145
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,640
So the right arrow.

146
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,230
We want to calculate that.

147
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:21,240
So let's just copy this and let's get right arrow.

148
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,810
And instead of selling the left position, we want to set from the right the same thing, 15 VW minus

149
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,070
sixty five.

150
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,140
And that should put that and put them in the right spot.

151
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:39,210
Now we don't want these to actually be have a higher Z index than this because you can see right here

152
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,620
it's going over it.

153
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:46,530
So we're going to get rid of that Z index of 100 and save and now you can't see the edge.

154
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,540
It's just kind of coming off of the image.

155
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,170
And then one other thing, when I click on this, you see that outline?

156
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,240
We want to get rid of that.

157
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,250
So let's go up here and say Arrow.

158
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:03,010
When it's in the focus state, we want to set the outline to zero.

159
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,400
So now we shouldn't have that outline.

160
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,350
And we also want the arrow to be white.

161
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:14,070
So right here, arrow, let's go color and set that to white.

162
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,510
All right, cool.

163
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,980
So that gives us a success.

164
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,720
One other thing.

165
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,150
Let's make it a point when we hover over it.

166
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,640
So we'll add cursor pointer.

167
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:25,870
There we go.

168
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,320
So our success is done now.

169
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,240
We want obviously, we want this to function.

170
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,570
We want to be able to slide the image, also the background image.

171
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,450
So in the next video, we'll start on the JavaScript.
