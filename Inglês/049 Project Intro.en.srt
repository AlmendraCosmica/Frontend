1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,130
All right, so this is kind of a cool little project, basically we're going to just track glasses of

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:12,270
water or cups of water and basically we have a goal of two leaders and we have this big cup here and

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,530
this is just all success.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:16,760
So we're going to style this and then add some JavaScript functionality.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:22,410
So if I click on this first one here, you can see that we have twelve point five percent of our two

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:22,970
leaders.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,740
We have one point seventy five liters remaining.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,810
And if I click on, like the fourth one here, it's going to not only highlight this one or fill this

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,610
cup, but all the way up to that cup.

10
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,630
And now you can see I have 50 percent and one leader remaining.

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,600
And then here, you know, zero point seven five remaining, sixty two point five I go to 100 percent

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,700
fills up the whole thing.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:49,350
So I think it's a cool little project to kind of manipulate the dom, do a little bit of calculation

14
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,300
in the JavaScript.

15
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,140
So let's go ahead and get started.
