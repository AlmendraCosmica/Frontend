1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,820
All right, so in the last video, we created our e-mail, which is pretty simple and a lot of the styling,

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:12,060
so we set the positions of the needles and so on in this square right here, we can actually get rid

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,370
of that.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,290
Now, I just wanted you to see kind of the outline of the clock.

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,170
So this background color on the clock class, we can get rid of that.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,080
And then let's start on the center point.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,590
So we have a class of center point and we're going to use the Centerpoint class, but we're also going

8
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:36,690
to use the after pseudo selector because we want it to be basically two circles.

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,090
So we need to style both.

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,450
So it's going to be a circle within a circle.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:51,670
So for this, let's set the background color and we're going to set that to, let's say E seven, E

12
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,370
seven four, C, three C, so it's the same color as the second needle.

13
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,290
We could put that in a variable, but these are the only two places we're using it in the right next

14
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:01,800
to each other.

15
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:02,820
So this should be fine.

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:13,680
And then I'm going to set the width to ten pixels and also the height to ten pixels.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,820
So you can see it's just a square and it's positioned static right now, which is the default positioning.

18
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:27,730
So we want to position absolute and as far as where we want to put it, we want to top 50 percent.

19
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:35,940
And this is within the clock class where that's that gray square was and let's say from the left, 50

20
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,610
percent.

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,510
Now, that's not directly in the middle.

22
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,980
So we need to use transform and we want to translate on both axes.

23
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:53,260
So let's say translate and then just negative 50.

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,780
So we want to pull it back negative 50 on Xanthi.

25
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,490
So that'll put it directly in the middle.

26
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:01,370
And we want this to be a circle.

27
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,980
So let's set the border radius.

28
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,350
We're going to set that to 50 percent, which will make it a circle.

29
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:14,690
OK, and then I think and I think that's all we want to do here.

30
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,130
Now, we also want to add a like a black dot in the middle.

31
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,770
So I'm going to copy let's actually just copy this whole thing and say center point and then we're going

32
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,660
to use colon, colon after.

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,140
And since we're using after, we need to add a content property here, which will just be an empty string.

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,370
And I'm going to set the background color to the primary color, whatever that is.

35
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:50,030
So let's say var dash, dash, primary color and the width and the height.

36
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,000
We want this to be smaller because this is going to be in the middle of the other in the middle of the

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,800
red circle.

38
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,320
So we'll set that to five pixels position.

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,210
Absolute this this is all good.

40
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:01,080
That's all the same.

41
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:08,160
So if I save that now we have a little black dot in the middle of our center point, OK, now it's style

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,910
like the text.

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,560
So we have the class of time.

44
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,600
I'm to set the font size here to 60 pixels.

45
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,810
So nice and big and then the class of date.

46
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:28,230
So date I'm going to make the color triple A and then let's set the font size to 14 pixels.

47
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,050
Let's set the letter spacing.

48
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,190
I'm going to do the zero point three pixels and let's make it uppercase.

49
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,530
So text transform will set that to uppercase.

50
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,740
Now the the the date, like the two here, has a span around it with the class of circle.

51
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:57,750
So let's say for date circle, let's make the background color, the primary color

52
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,860
and let's make the color the secondary color.

53
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:18,170
And we want it to be a circle, so border radius is going to be 50 percent at that.

54
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:19,920
All right.

55
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:26,080
And then let's add a Hitner with so we'll do 18 pixels.

56
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:39,550
And let's set I'm actually going to display this as in line Fleck's.

57
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,810
OK, and then we want to obviously you want the number in the middle, so let's do a line items center

58
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,940
and let's do justify content center seats that are put in the middle.

59
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,160
And then I'm just going to change the line height to the same as the font size 18 pixels.

60
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,340
And then that when it changes, I want to have a transition.

61
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:14,810
So at a transition, let's say zero point five seconds is in.

62
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,390
OK, so I think that that looks pretty good.

63
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,680
Actually, the font size, let's say, font size 12 pixels.

64
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,560
All right, so now we have basically our UI done here.

65
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,090
And in the next video, we want to make this function OK.

66
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,820
We want to make the clock work, want to show the date and time.

67
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,770
We want to be able to change to light mode or change to dark mode and back.

68
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,350
So we'll get into all of that in the next video.
