1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,310
OK, so this is going to be a pretty quick project, we should be able to get it done in one video pretty

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:05,760
quickly.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:11,610
So let's change the title here to toast notification.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:22,560
And then down here, the way this is going to work is we'll have an idea with the idea of toasts.

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:26,580
And I want to be able to have multiple toasts.

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:30,960
So basically, you know, one can show up and then another can show on top of it, another on top of

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,850
it, and then they'll just disappear after whatever, three seconds.

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,570
So we'll have an idea of toasts, which we'll put right in the HTML.

9
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:46,050
And then the divs with the class of toast like this will actually get inserted via JavaScript.

10
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:50,280
But just for now, we'll go ahead and, you know, put some in here.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,550
So we'll say hello world and we'll say toast number two.

12
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:05,700
And then I want to button give it a class of B10 and then let's give us an idea of button and just say

13
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,880
show notification.

14
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,420
All right.

15
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,220
So, I mean, we're just going to have it.

16
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,450
So we click the button.

17
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,800
It shows a random message.

18
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,650
But of course, you could do form validation or any kind of of, you know, any time you want to notify

19
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,980
the user of something, you could use this.

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,790
So let's do the styling.

21
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,760
The the font that I that we're going to use is Poppins, Floren Pop's favorite font.

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,300
And then wait 200, 400.

23
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,240
Add that here.

24
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,140
And a set of background color.

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,290
So background color.

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:55,920
We're going to set that to Rebecca Purple and we can just leave the rest of this stuff in the body and

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:05,190
let's style the button so we have a class of BTN going to give it a background color of white and give

28
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,190
it a color hopes.

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,410
That's fine.

30
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:17,250
Give it a color of Rebecca Purple and then let's give it a font family.

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:26,670
We want to inherit Poppins and then font weight is going to be bold and padding.

32
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:32,460
I'm going to add one REM and border radius.

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,080
Let's do five pixels and get rid of the border.

34
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,550
So border nun and cursor, we want that to be a pointer.

35
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:50,860
And then for the outline here, let's get rid of that, so the button focus state, we're going to set

36
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,290
the outline to none and then the active state.

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,900
So when we click it, I just wanted to scale down a little bit.

38
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:10,000
So set transform scale from one two point nine, eight cases are button.

39
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,300
And then let's start to let's do the toast.

40
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:22,030
So we have toast, plural, which is the container, and we want this to display fixed down in the bottom

41
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,970
corner and then we want to style each toast.

42
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:33,900
So let's start with the idea of Tostes that I give it an ID or class.

43
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,040
Yeah.

44
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,070
And I gave it an idea.

45
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,920
I mean, you could use a class if you if you want if you don't like styling with the ID.

46
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,350
But I'm not going to use the ID here.

47
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:46,210
And let's display first of all, position it.

48
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:53,830
So position this to be fixed and I want it in the bottom corner so we'll say from the bottom ten pixels

49
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,440
and from the right ten pixels.

50
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:01,240
And of course you could put this up but you could put them up at the top over here wherever you want.

51
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:08,170
But I want to put it in the bottom here and then let's do display flex.

52
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,540
And I don't want it to be a row.

53
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,190
I do want them to be on top of each other.

54
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,250
So we'll do Flex Direction column.

55
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:22,030
And I want to align to the end so we'll align items to flex and.

56
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,580
And that should be good for the for the container, so now let's style each individual toast.

57
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:44,790
So for that, let's set the background color to whites and we'll set the color to Rebecca Purple and

58
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:50,810
the border radius to five pixels and padding.

59
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:56,910
We're going to do one room, top and bottom to room, left and right, and let's separate them out.

60
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,180
So margin will be zero point five REM.

61
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:02,340
All right.

62
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,460
And obviously, you can style these however you want, but I think that's all right.

63
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:12,980
So now let's take these out of the HTML because these will be inserted with JavaScript.

64
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:18,480
So basically you would have, you know, your Web page or form whatever it is, and then you'd have

65
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:24,460
this just somewhere on the page so that your toes can display and its display.

66
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:25,920
I'm sorry.

67
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,210
It's positioned fixed.

68
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,990
So it's always going to be, you know, at the bottom corner or wherever you decide to put it.

69
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:37,170
So in our script here, let's bring in the button so we can add in the event listener on it.

70
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:43,390
So Button set that to document dot get element vidi.

71
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,090
And we gave that an idea of button.

72
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,070
Let's also bring in the container or Tostes.

73
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:04,040
OK, and then I'm just going to have an array of random messages here, so I'm just going to do message

74
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,540
one, two, three and four.

75
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,770
I mean, we don't have to do this, I can't count, we don't have to do this.

76
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,280
We could just have like an argument, a message passed and as an argument.

77
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,160
But this just makes it a little bit more fun.

78
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,550
So we have an array of just random messages.

79
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,190
Now we want to take our button and we want to add an event.

80
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,920
Listener, listen for a click.

81
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:45,890
And run a function here and let's call a function called create notification, if you want to leave

82
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,590
at any time, pause the video and do this.

83
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:50,930
Just try to do this yourself without any guidance.

84
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,630
I would invite you to do that.

85
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,840
So let's create create notification.

86
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,060
And inside here, let's just make sure this is working.

87
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,750
So I'm just going to console log one, two, three and see console good.

88
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,870
So that we know that's working now in here.

89
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:19,220
We want to create the notification div because remember it's going to be a div with the class of toast.

90
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:28,130
So let's say consed we'll call this note if said it to on the document object, we have a method called

91
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:34,700
create element to create any kind of HTML element we want, we want this to be a div and then we want

92
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,150
to add a class to that.

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:47,060
So let's say notify DOT class list add and we're going to add tost class of toast.

94
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:54,490
We also need to decide what we want to put inside the div as the text is the message so we can say notify

95
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,120
DOT in our text and you could set this to anything you want.

96
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,890
He could just put a string here.

97
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,310
Or you could you could have it come in as an argument.

98
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:13,430
We're going to have a separate function called get random message, which I'll go outside of this function

99
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,300
now and create.

100
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,210
And it's pretty simple.

101
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,910
So we just want to we have our array up here.

102
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:27,620
So let's just return from this function messages, which is our array with with a random index.

103
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,300
So, you know, we can do zero one, whatever.

104
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:37,970
So let's do math dot floor to round down math, dot random.

105
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,130
So that'll give us a random decimal.

106
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:49,670
We want to multiply that by messages at length so that the you know, however many elements or items

107
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,670
are in the messages array.

108
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,960
So it'll give us a random message.

109
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:00,680
And then to put it into the dorm, we're going to take the container ships, take the container and

110
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,710
let's append why it's doing that.

111
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,870
I bring in the container.

112
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,170
Oh, I called it Tostes.

113
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:06,670
That's right.

114
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:16,880
So Tostes, which is basically the toast container we're going to append child and we want to append

115
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,660
into that the notification.

116
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,550
All right.

117
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:25,130
So if I see that I come over here and I click, I see message to message one, message three.

118
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,470
So it's just going to be random and they just keep adding up.

119
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:31,460
Now, obviously, you're not going to want that.

120
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,870
You don't want them to stay there.

121
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,990
There's a few things you could do, you could put like an X button so you can close it up, but we're

122
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,170
just going to make it disappear after a certain amount of time.

123
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:52,670
So after the the toast is put into the dorm, we're going to run a set time out, which takes in a function.

124
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:02,690
And we just want to remove it from the dorm completely, so we'll take our notification and remove or

125
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:08,360
just remove it from the dorm now set time out takes a second argument of the time that you want to wait

126
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,070
until you run the function.

127
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,140
So we're going to wait 300 milliseconds, which is three seconds.

128
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,780
So if I save that and I click show notification a few times after three seconds, the first one goes,

129
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,140
you know, then the second, third.

130
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:28,300
So even if there is a bunch of messages, they're all going to disappear, which is what we want.

131
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:31,970
Now, in reality, you're probably not going to do like a random message.

132
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:34,620
You want a specific message when you call this function.

133
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:38,930
So what we could do is pass in something like this.

134
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,110
This is invalid data or something like that.

135
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,570
And then we could pass in here as an as a parameter, a message.

136
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:59,780
And what we'll do is set that to null by default so that down here in the inner text, we can say if

137
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:05,030
message, then show the message or else get a random message.

138
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:09,590
So now if I click show notification, it's going to give us this is invalid data because that's what

139
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:10,670
we passed in here.

140
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:17,330
And you would probably you know, you would only call this once and we could also and I'm just kind

141
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,740
of just winging it here.

142
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,940
I didn't plan on doing this.

143
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,440
But just to give you a better idea of how you would actually do this, because you wouldn't actually

144
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,330
do random messages, I don't think.

145
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,800
But we could do a type as well, like pass in a type which will just set to null by default.

146
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,030
And a type could be like a CSFs class.

147
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,150
So we could actually copy that down.

148
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,590
And let's say add.

149
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:58,760
So we'll do say if there's a type, then add that type as a class else, then else then I guess set

150
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:13,490
it to like info and then we could go on our success and we could say tost dot info.

151
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,680
So it should be a class.

152
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:23,870
So tost info pops and we could take the color up here.

153
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,930
And no, I don't want to duplicate it, I want to bring it down into here.

154
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,200
So that'll be the info and then we'll take that.

155
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:45,890
Let's do a success class and we'll make that green and we could take those who could take this one here

156
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:50,180
and call this error and make that red.

157
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,090
So right now, if I see this, it's going to it's going to be purple.

158
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,820
It should have a class of info.

159
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:06,230
But if I were to add in here a type of, let's say, success.

160
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:15,150
Now they're green, so we have the ability to do that, another thing we could do is just for fun is

161
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:18,260
have some random types, just like we did with the messages.

162
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,890
So we'll see CONSE types and we'll set that to an array and let's say info

163
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,390
success.

164
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,550
And it was the other one error.

165
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:43,700
And we could create a function just like this to get random, get a random type and just take from the

166
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:47,280
types array of random random item.

167
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,340
Actually, one thing we want to do is make sure that when we get the types we use, the types, the

168
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:57,020
length here, or else it's going to be because there's more messages and types.

169
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:04,310
And then where we have this ternary where we're saying, you know, if there is a type and use that,

170
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:08,690
if not use enfolds change info to get random type.

171
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,090
Now at the moment we have this is invalid data and success.

172
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,300
Pastan, which actually doesn't make sense.

173
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,830
That should probably be error because that's that's an error.

174
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:24,050
But if we take out both of these and we just call create notification, then everything's random.

175
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:30,470
So the message is random and the class or the type is also random.

176
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:37,720
All right, so, I mean, the random stuff is it's just for fun, but you can see what how you would

177
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,670
actually add this in your application.

178
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:44,860
If you wanted to add these little tost messages, maybe you'd have some kind of form validation.

179
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:51,340
And, you know, if you're if the name isn't included or whatever, you could go ahead and run create

180
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,100
notification with a specific type and message.

181
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:54,910
All right.

182
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,690
So that's it, guys.

183
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,370
Hopefully you enjoyed this little project and we'll jump into the next one.
