1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,660
OK, so let's get started on our form input wave project, I have my project start are open here.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,280
It's going to say form input wave and then let's get rid of this, each one.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,960
And we're just going to wrap a container around our form.

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,240
So we'll have a container with an H1.

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,630
We'll just say please log in basic login form and we'll have a form tag here.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,770
We don't need an action.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,040
And and here we're going to have a form Dasch Control, which will wrap around the input which is going

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,120
to be typed text.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,270
I'm also going to add required, which will just give it some basic validation and then the label is

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,320
going to go underneath and we don't really need a four.

11
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,630
So we'll get rid of that and say email and then I'm going to go ahead and copy that down.

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,020
And this one is going to be password.

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,730
So type password and label password underneath that form control.

14
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:06,210
We're going to have a button and I'm going to give it a class of B10 and let's just say log in and then

15
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,430
we'll have a live with the class of text.

16
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:19,200
Actually it's to a parallel to a paragraph class of text and say don't have an account and if they don't

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,970
have an account then we'll just have a link.

18
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,850
Doesn't have to go anywhere and say register.

19
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,050
All right.

20
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,010
So that's our form.

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,950
Pretty simple.

22
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,720
Now, before I get into CSFs, I just want to kind of explain what we're going to be doing as far as,

23
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,920
you know, how to do this.

24
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:44,250
And we want to use JavaScript to basically wrap each letter in a in a span and we're going to have a

25
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,710
transition on that span to move it up.

26
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:53,190
So or transform translate y value to move it up with a transition to make it smooth.

27
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,990
And in JavaScript, when we wrap the span around each letter, we're also going to add a transition

28
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:04,950
delay to each one that increases every letter so that, you know, the first one goes up and then this

29
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,300
the end would be delayed.

30
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,510
Then it would go up a would be even more delayed, then it would go up.

31
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,980
So it gives it that wave effect.

32
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,620
So that's ultimately what we're going to end up with.

33
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,060
In fact, I'll go ahead and just paste in what these labels will look like afterwards.

34
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,960
So basically we'll have, you know, the label tag.

35
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,880
You don't have to put this in.

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,460
I'm just showing you as an example, we'll have each letter wrapped in a span with a transition delay

37
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,510
that increments.

38
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,290
So I'm just going to comment that out.

39
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,750
But just so you can see what we're going to end up with.

40
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,580
But before we get into any of that, let's just do some basic styling on this form because it looks

41
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,120
horrible.

42
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:54,960
So I'm going to use the mollifies so we'll do family equals and Muli and then let's set the set that

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:03,870
on the body and then I'm going to set a background color for the body to steal blue and the color of

44
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,630
the text to white.

45
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:18,660
That's and then let's style, uh, let's see, we'll do the container and let's add a background color

46
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,490
of our GBA.

47
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,140
I want it to have just kind of a transparent look, so black and then zero point four for the alpha

48
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,000
value and let's add padding.

49
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,080
So padding.

50
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,440
We're going to do twenty pixels, top and bottom, forty left and right.

51
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:38,970
And let's add a slight border radius of five pixels.

52
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,440
All right.

53
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,410
And then let's do container each one.

54
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,090
So for that I want to text a line to the center.

55
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:52,140
I also want to add a margin on the bottom of thirty pixels.

56
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,750
OK, and then the link, let's say container A which is just the register link.

57
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,120
I want to text decoration none.

58
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:06,330
Take away the underline and the color will be let's put the color to light blue.

59
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,830
So now we want to get into the form fields first we have the form control, which wraps around the input

60
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:21,820
and the labels, so it's a form control and I'm going to position that relative because I want the label

61
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,880
to be positioned absolute within it.

62
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:29,740
And then for margin, let's do 20 top and bottom zero left and right, 40 bottom.

63
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,300
And I'm going to just settle with of three hundred pixels.

64
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:35,950
All right.

65
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:38,770
And then let's do the inputs.

66
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:40,570
So form control input.

67
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:49,680
I'm going to set the background color to transparent and then get rid of that border.

68
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,150
But I do want a border on the bottom.

69
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,060
So let's say border

70
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,110
border dash bottom.

71
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:01,090
And I'm going to set that to two pixels.

72
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,570
Let's do whites and solid.

73
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,930
OK, now I want on its own line.

74
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:10,600
So instead of inline, we want to display block.

75
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,100
I also want it to go all the way across, all set with to 100 percent.

76
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:18,220
And we'll add some padding.

77
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:28,210
Let's do 15 pixels on the top and bottom and the font size for the input I'm going to set to 18 pixels.

78
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,420
And I think we should be good there.

79
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,890
Let's get the color to white.

80
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:42,450
And then the border here are the outline, I should say, we want to get rid of that also, if I submit

81
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:45,170
and it's invalid, you get that border as well.

82
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,750
So let's target form control inputs.

83
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:58,920
And when it's in its focus, also, we want form, control, input, valid, and we're going to just

84
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,990
set the outline on that to zero.

85
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:04,800
OK, so now we don't have that ugly border.

86
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,150
Now, before we do, I think we're going to do the label stuff in the next video.

87
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:16,830
But let's finish like the button and the text down here.

88
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,920
So we have a class of actually we put this up, we'll do all the form stuff down at the bottom.

89
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,240
So let's do BTN.

90
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:31,230
And I'm just going to set the cursor to a point where I'm going to display as an inline block.

91
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:40,860
For our button here, and I want it to go all the way across, we'll say, with 100 percent and let's

92
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:47,640
set the background of the button to light blue and let's set the padding.

93
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:56,480
We'll do padding 15 pixels and let's Refaat family, we're going to inherit.

94
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:05,340
And then for fun size, let's put that to 16 pixels and the border.

95
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,510
We want to get rid of that.

96
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,860
So border zero.

97
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:13,320
And I'm going to make the border radius, same as the container, five pixels.

98
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:18,660
And I think that's all we want to do.

99
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:26,430
Let's say let's add on let's say BTN focus set that outline.

100
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:28,590
Actually, we can add that down here.

101
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,450
No, because we're going to add something else there.

102
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:42,900
Yeah, let's just do outline zero on BTN focus and we can have a little hover effect too.

103
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:47,770
So I mean, not hover, click effect or hover, whatever you want.

104
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,950
So we're going to do button and when it's active.

105
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:56,020
So when we click down on it, we're going to add a transform and just scale it down a bit.

106
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,530
So scale it from one two point ninety so we get that little effect.

107
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:00,940
All right.

108
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,330
Yes, I think what else the text here, we can move that down a little bit, so under the button stuff,

109
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:16,570
we have a class of text and it's going to set the margin top to 30 pixels, push that down a bit.

110
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,600
Now, the label, don't worry about that.

111
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,990
We're going to we're going to style that next.

112
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:29,260
And like I said, we need to use JavaScript to turn the label into letters with span's around them with

113
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,350
a transition delay.

114
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,760
We're also going to have a transition, obviously, on the label span.

115
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,220
So we'll get into that in the next video.
