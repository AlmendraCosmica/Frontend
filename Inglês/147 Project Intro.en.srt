1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,760
All right, in this project, we're going to create a little quiz application, so we have this question

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,370
here, which language runs in a Web browser?

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,400
And we have some answers, some multiple choice.

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,010
We're going to go ahead and choose JavaScript and submit.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,990
And it's going to take us to the next question.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,580
What is CSFs stand for?

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,300
Central stylesheets, cascading style sheets, cascading simple sheets, cars, SUVs, sailboats, go

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,970
ahead and choose cards, cars, SUV, sailboats.

9
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,030
And then what does each HTML stand for?

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,310
Hypertext markup language?

11
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:36,270
And then what year was JavaScript launch, which was 1995?

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,400
And you can see we answered three out of four questions correctly and we can reload the quiz.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,030
So it's pretty simple in terms of functionality.

14
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,240
What we'll do is create like a basic template that we can use to insert the questions and answers using

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,570
a JavaScript array, and then we'll add the functionality to select an answer and check it and so on.

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,360
Add to the score and increment it.

17
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,200
So let's go ahead and get started.
