1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,090
All right, we're going to get started on our hidden search form.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:06,720
So in our time out here, I have my project started.

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:13,500
You can also see I have the font awesome link here because we're going to be using the search icon for

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:13,980
the button.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,100
So let's change this to a hidden search.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:27,360
And then down here in the body, let's create a div with the class of search and this div is going to

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,940
wrap both the input and the button, and that's really all we have.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,030
So let's add the input.

9
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:41,420
I'm going to give this a we'll give this a class of input and the type is going to be text.

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,020
Let's also add a placeholder.

11
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,200
So placeholder will just be search, dot, dot, dot.

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:55,230
And then right after the input will have the button and the button is going to have a class of beats

13
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:58,380
and inside that button will have an ID tag with the font.

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,490
Awesome icon.

15
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:04,940
So fase and a dash search for the icon.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,230
So I save it.

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,320
We're going to see this.

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,950
Just a regular looking ugly search form.

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,350
So let's jump into our success.

20
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:22,200
Basically, what we want to do is have a class of active and when we when it's active, the the input

21
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,350
here will expand and the button will move over.

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,380
And we wanted to start with just just showing the button.

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,750
So let's just get some general styles in here first as far as the body goes.

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:41,340
I want to add a background, let's say background image, and I'm going to use a linear gradient so

25
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,710
we'll see a linear gradient.

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:55,770
Let's do a 90 degree gradients and four colors will do the hexadecimal value of 75 F, F, F, and let's

27
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:01,450
do hexadecimal seven one five eight E two.

28
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:09,690
OK, so those are going to be our colors and we need to put a semicolon here that I forgot.

29
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,950
Where am I?

30
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,760
Where's my cursor.

31
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:19,600
OK, so now we have that background gradient, you can probably make this a little smaller here.

32
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:28,810
OK, so background now we want to display Fleck's align everything to the center.

33
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,150
We don't need we don't need where is it?

34
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:35,450
Flex Direction as a column height 100 viewport.

35
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,280
It's good.

36
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,820
The search class.

37
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,060
I'm going to position this relative so we can position things inside of it absolu.

38
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,300
And let's set the initial height here to 50 pixels.

39
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,640
And then for the input, I mean, that has a class of input actually.

40
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:10,890
Let's do search input and let's set a background color of white and let's set a border of zero.

41
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:18,250
Take away any border and I'm going to make the font size 18 pixels will make that a little bigger.

42
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:32,650
And let's set the padding on this to 15 pixels all around and we'll set the height to 50 pixels and

43
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:37,020
let's set the width to 50 pixels.

44
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:43,660
So it's going to start off short like this, but then we'll have an animation or a transition to expand

45
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:43,810
it.

46
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:50,410
So I want to add here a transition on the width property.

47
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:55,690
OK, so we want the width to have a transition that's going to last zero point three seconds with an

48
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,530
EZ effect.

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:08,470
Now for the button, let's style that, so that has a class of BTN and we're going to set a background

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,990
color of white.

51
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,920
And let's set a border of zero.

52
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:25,410
We want the cursor to be a pointer when we hover over it, we want a font size of twenty four pixels.

53
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,920
So remember, this is the button with the icon.

54
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:37,850
And I want to position this absolute within the within the search class here, the search container

55
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:42,890
and let's say from the top zero and from the left zero.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,250
And then we're going to give this a height and width of 50 pixels.

57
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,940
OK, so it puts it right in the middle there and then I want to transition on this, because what we

58
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,090
want to do with the button is move it over.

59
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,510
We want the the input to it to expand the width.

60
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:10,640
We have the transition for that up here, the button we want to push over.

61
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,480
OK, so the input gets wider, the button gets pushed over.

62
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,170
So we'll use transform on that.

63
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:23,650
So we want to add a transition for transform same amount of time as the width on the input and and ease

64
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,170
effect.

65
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:34,460
OK, and then we want to get rid of any outline, so let's grab, let's say, the BTN when it's in its

66
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,140
focus state and also the input when it's in its focus state.

67
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:43,850
We want to set the outline to none.

68
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,810
OK, so now we don't see that outline.

69
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:52,190
And then finally, we want to take the search.

70
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:03,330
Inputs, but when it's active, so the search class, if it has an active class, then we want the input

71
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,010
to go to 200 pixels from what was it, 50?

72
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,980
Yeah, so it starts at 50.

73
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:18,480
And then when and when the search element has an active class on it, then the width will go to 200.

74
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:21,070
And then we also want the button to move over.

75
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,320
We have a trend, a transition on the transform, but we haven't actually created that yet.

76
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:34,190
So also when the search has the class of active on it that we want to take the button, we want to set

77
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,960
transform and we want to move it.

78
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:39,660
We want to move it along the X axis.

79
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,070
We want to move it to the right so we can use translate X.

80
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:50,340
So translate on the X axis and we'll move it over one hundred and ninety eight pixels.

81
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,530
All right.

82
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:59,460
So if I save that, we're not going to see any difference here because we need a little bit of JavaScript

83
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:05,240
to be able to give it that class and you'll see if I manually put on the active class here.

84
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,030
There we go.

85
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,840
It expands.

86
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,240
So JavaScript is going to be really simple.

87
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,880
Let's go ahead and bring in the search.

88
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,130
So document dot.

89
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,190
Query selector.

90
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:25,230
And we want to grab the class of search and then let's also grab the BGN.

91
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:36,980
PETN, and then let's grab the input input and then I'm going to take the button and we want an event

92
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:41,020
listener on that, so we want to add an event listener of a click event.

93
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:47,240
And when we click, we're going to call an arrow function here.

94
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,030
And all we want to do is take the search.

95
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:53,360
Remember the search div, which I just showed you?

96
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,390
If I put an active class on that, it widens it out, pushes the button over.

97
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,610
So that's what we want to do.

98
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:06,230
We want to say from search, we have our class list and then there's a method called toggle to toggle

99
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,450
a class, basically just add and remove it.

100
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,200
So we'll toggle the class of active.

101
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:16,800
I also want to set focus on the input, which we can just use the focus method.

102
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,690
All right.

103
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,990
So if I go over here and I click, it not only opens it and, you know, pushes the button over, widens

104
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:27,320
the input, but it also focuses in the in there.

105
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:34,310
And if I click goes back and you can see just from the projects we've done so far and some of the ones

106
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:41,630
that we're going to do a lot of this just it's all just putting specific classes through our JavaScript,

107
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,880
through events, you know, clicking or hovering over something and making an event far off where we

108
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,730
just add or remove or toggle a class and then we have a transition to give us a cool little animation.

109
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,070
So there's very little need for something like Jan to do stuff like this anymore.

110
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:04,640
You just use vanilla JavaScript to mix with success and you can do just about any kind of animation

111
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,650
that you can do with J query pretty easily.
