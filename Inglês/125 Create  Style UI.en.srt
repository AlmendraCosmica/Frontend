1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,680
All right, we're going to get started on our mobile tab navigation, so let's go ahead and create the

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,660
user interface.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,290
I just have my project Project Starter open here.

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,370
Let's open up all of these files.

5
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,720
And I'm also bringing font awesome in using the CDN because we will be using font awesome icons for

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,700
the menu items.

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:29,960
So let's call this mobile tab navigation and get rid of that.

8
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:33,300
So everything is going to be wrapped in a class of phone.

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,060
So we'll have kind of like a phone UI container here.

10
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,400
And then for the images, I'm actually going to paste these in.

11
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,870
Let me paste in the first one.

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,170
So these are from on splash.

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,260
Of course you can use any image you want or you don't even have to use images if you want it to be content

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,510
or whatever text content, that's fine.

15
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:02,730
But we're giving this a class of content so all of them will have this content class.

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,320
But whichever one is showing is going to have a class of show.

17
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,460
OK, so I'm going to grab the other three images, which all have the class of content but do not have

18
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,720
the class of show.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,530
OK, only the first one has the class or show.

20
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,730
So let me just push these over three or four images.

21
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,770
Now, the navigation we're going to put right under the last image here, let's put a nav tag and in

22
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,980
here we're going to have a little with a list item and then we'll have our icon.

23
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,910
So let's use font.

24
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,570
Awesome here.

25
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:48,630
It's going to be Fayaz and a dash home and underneath that will have a paragraph with the text of home.

26
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,630
OK, right now these images are going to be giant.

27
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,820
So just ignore this for now and then let's copy this list item here.

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,130
We're going to have three more.

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:09,810
So the second one here, the icon will be Box and this is going to be work and this one here.

30
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:18,420
Let's do the icon book Dash Open and this will be blog.

31
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,980
And then this last one here is going to be for users and this one will be about us.

32
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,350
All right, so that should do it.

33
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:37,090
Let's jump into the stylesheet here and I'm going to use Open Sans for my phonte, so I'm going to get

34
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,950
rid of this.

35
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:50,030
So to success and then questionmark and let's say family equals open, plus Sande's.

36
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:55,780
And then for the family here, we'll say open sans.

37
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,610
And we want a background color on the body here.

38
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,810
So background color.

39
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,640
I'm going to use Rajiva so red and will be 155.

40
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:17,080
Green will be 89, blue will be 182 and the alpha value will be zero point seven.

41
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:25,660
OK, so give us that purple color and then we have see flex direction.

42
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:34,150
We can get rid of that midnite, we get ready overflow hidden and you can go ahead and you can scroll

43
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,700
down, see all the images actually there.

44
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,840
They're all out of whack.

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,640
So we'll fix that soon.

46
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:44,740
So the class of foam wraps around everything.

47
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:55,150
And for that, let's set set the position of that to be relative so we can position stuff absolute within

48
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,330
it.

49
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,290
And I'm going to set overflow to hidden on that.

50
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:09,120
And let's set the border so we're going to have a border of three pixels solid and the color will be

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,890
triple he and let's set a border radius.

52
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:25,240
And also the border radius to 15 pixels and then let's at the height of this to six hundred pixels and

53
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,250
the width will be 340.

54
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:34,300
OK, so now we can see our image, the content inside.

55
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,490
So each image has a class of content.

56
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:36,760
Right.

57
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,680
So let's say phone and then the content, which is the image.

58
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,880
We're going to initially set the opacity to zero.

59
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,130
As soon as I do that, though, it's going to go away.

60
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,790
I'm going to just comment that out for now so we can style the rest.

61
00:04:52,350 --> 00:05:04,120
Let's set object fit to cover and let's set the position of this to be absolute and then we'll set from

62
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,890
the top zero and from the left zero.

63
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,990
And you might see a different image, too, because remember, they're just all the images are they

64
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,420
are they're just in the same place.

65
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,770
And then for the height of this.

66
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:27,450
Basically, we're going to have down here our tabs and it's going to be about 60 pixels high.

67
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,720
So what we'll do is use calc here and we can calculate, we'll say 100 percent of the high, but minus

68
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,150
it by, let's say, 60 pixels so that it gives us a little bit of room down there.

69
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:46,050
And let's just make sure the width we set this to 100 percent and we're going to have a transition on

70
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:51,480
this, because when we change the image, basically when we, you know, rotate the class of show,

71
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,270
we wanted to have that kind of fade in effect.

72
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,820
So the transition is going to be on the opacity property zero point four seconds.

73
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,780
And he's.

74
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:11,550
Now, the content that has show, so let's say phone dash content, if it has a class of show, we want

75
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:13,620
the opacity to be one.

76
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:17,520
So let's go back up here and uncommented this that way.

77
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,730
The only image that's going to show or the only content that's going to show has that opacity of one.

78
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:28,770
OK, so it's this first one here because it has that class.

79
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,570
If I go on, I put show on this one, it's going to show that image OK?

80
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,090
And it doesn't have to be an image.

81
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,930
It could be some kind of content if you want.

82
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,620
Now it's style, the navigation.

83
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:50,370
So the NAV, I want to position that to be absolute within the phone container so you can see that we

84
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,070
can see it now, but it doesn't look very good.

85
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,700
Let's put it to the bottom so we'll see from the bottom zero and from the left zero, which is going

86
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,690
to move it down there.

87
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,800
And then let's set a margin top of negative five pixels, which is going to just bring it up a little

88
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:15,150
bit and let's set the width so the width here to 100 percent.

89
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:23,760
OK, now let's style let's style the menu because, you know, we don't want this to be going vertical.

90
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,930
We don't want list spots.

91
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,550
We want it to go across here.

92
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,320
So we'll start with the US.

93
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:38,610
So let's say now, well, I'm going to set the background color to white and let's set it to display

94
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,370
flex so that all of the list items will line up in a row as flex items.

95
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:50,640
I'm going to set list style type to none because I don't want any bullet points.

96
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:56,490
I'm going to set the padding and the margin to zero.

97
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:05,750
And the height is going to be 60 pixels and you can change this, but it should match whatever you have

98
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:11,890
up here in this calc value where we're taking that away from 100 percent of the height of the phone.

99
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,110
And I think that's all we want to do there.

100
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:18,680
Now for the list items, let's say NAV list items.

101
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,110
Let's do a actually one background color.

102
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,790
We want to color of seven.

103
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:34,700
It's going to make those lighter out a cursor pointer and we want them to be all spread out the same

104
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,060
width.

105
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,010
So out of flex value of one.

106
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:46,000
And the padding, we'll just do 10 pixels all the way around and let's text a line center.

107
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:53,660
So move the text moving from the left to the center and then let's see for the the text down here is

108
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,890
wrapped in a paragraph.

109
00:08:54,890 --> 00:09:03,560
So we'll say NAV Ally paragraph or nav doesn't really matter, but we're going to select the paragraph

110
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:06,740
and I'm going to just change the font size to 12 pixels.

111
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:12,800
So make it a little smaller and then let's at the margin to two pixels, top and bottom zero, left

112
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,250
and right.

113
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,720
So paragraphs have a margin of 10 pixels by default.

114
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,290
We just lessened it to two when it, you know, took away that space.

115
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,990
And then whichever one is covered are active.

116
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,280
I want to change the color.

117
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,150
So let's say NAV will ally hover.

118
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,450
And also we want NAV.

119
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,720
You will ally if it has active

120
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,200
color.

121
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,080
And let's set that to hexadecimal eight E four for a D.

122
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:56,870
So basically we have you know, we have the show class on the image and that's that's what we want to

123
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,430
show.

124
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,940
And then whichever tab here is active, we'll also have a class of active like this.

125
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:15,180
And now you can see, since I put that class of active, it has that purple color, so that should be

126
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,530
it for the success in the next video, we'll go ahead and make this function to where we can click on

127
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:25,110
one of these and it will change the content to, you know, whichever tab we're clicking on.
