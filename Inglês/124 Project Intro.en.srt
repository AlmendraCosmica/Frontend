00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,800
OK, so in this video, in the audience, I should say, this project, we're going to be creating this

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,490
mobile looking UI here with an image for the content and then some tabs down here.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,410
We have homework blogging about us, and it's just going to show a different image, depending on which

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:17,250
tab we click.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,940
If I click this one, you'll see the image changes.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:26,430
So basically we're going to have a specific class of show on the content and a specific class of active

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,060
down here.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,420
You can see the active one will be highlighted in purple.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,060
So basically, we need to loop through these list items here, this menu, and add an event listener

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:43,200
on to each one so that we can remove, add and remove certain classes onto the content here, as well

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,760
as the items themselves.
