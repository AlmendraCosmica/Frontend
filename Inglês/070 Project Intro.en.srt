1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,190
All right, so this is actually one of my favorite projects in this course, this is a little drawing

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,310
app that we're going to create using HTML5 canvas.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,350
So we're going to use the canvas element.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,240
That's what this big square is.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,560
And there's a JavaScript API that we can use to draw shapes.

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,220
We can draw, you know, circles, rectangles, images, whatever lines.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,470
And we're going to implement that with mouse events so that we can actually click and we can draw,

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,540
OK, so we can draw.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:33,070
And then we're going to add these controls down here where we can actually change the color.

10
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:41,280
So change it to red start to draw and we can change the the width of the the pen or the line here.

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:48,450
So if I go down to five and see it's a little smaller, I'll change the color to like a greenish color

12
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,340
and bring this to 20.

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,340
OK, and the highest we can go is 50.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:59,580
So that's the thickness we can go and the lowest we can go is five and we can clear it with this button

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,910
here.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,570
So I think it's a cool little canvas app and I think you'll enjoy it.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,360
So let's go ahead and start on the interface and then we'll we'll talk a little bit about creating shapes,

18
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,420
creating circles and lines with canvas, and then we'll move into the mouse events and drawing and then

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,640
these two box controls down here.
