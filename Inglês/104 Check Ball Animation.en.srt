1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,990
OK, so now we want to create the animation for the ball to move back and forth when we click it, so

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,720
we're going to have two animation.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,360
So let's create those will say keyframes.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,060
This one is going to be called slide on.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,710
And this is just going to have it go from here to here.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,800
And we're going to do that by just changing the value of the translate x axis.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:31,880
So we'll use a transform property and set to translate X to be further over.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,000
We'll also scale it a bit.

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:43,200
So let's go ahead and say at zero percent of this animation, we want to transform and we're going to

10
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,780
set translate X because we're moving it on the X axis right to left or left to right.

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:54,600
In this case, we're going to start at zero and the scale is going to start at just one, which is what

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,190
it is by default.

13
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:09,660
And then at 50 percent, we want to set transform to translate X and go from zero to twenty pixels and

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,840
then set the scale to one point two and then at 100 percent.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:29,280
So say 100 percent, we want to transform, translate acts and this is going to be 40 pixels and set

16
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,910
scale back to one.

17
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:34,260
OK, so that's the slide on.

18
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,940
The slide off is basically just going to be this backwards.

19
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,960
So I'm going to just copy this and let's set this to slide off.

20
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:50,190
And zero percent is going to be at 40 pixels because it's going to be at the end scale one.

21
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,720
And then second is going to be the same 20 pixels and then third or 100 percent, I should say, is

22
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:01,350
going to be back at zero with a scale of one.

23
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,620
OK, so pretty simple animations.

24
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,430
Now, we need to implement this because, you know, we haven't added it to anything.

25
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:19,590
So for the ball, let's add animation and we want to set this to slide off and say zero point three

26
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,030
seconds for the duration.

27
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,150
We want it to be linear and forwards.

28
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:33,500
All right, and you can see as soon as I save, since I'm using live server, it automatically reloads.

29
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,260
It shows you that animation.

30
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,490
Now when we click on it, we check it.

31
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,350
We want to run slide on.

32
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,300
Right.

33
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,820
So let's go right here.

34
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:51,290
In the way we can target this with our success is the toggle, which is the checkbox input when it's

35
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,840
checked.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,100
OK, so Colin checked OK means in the checked state.

37
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,990
Then we want to add the label class and then the ball class.

38
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,840
That's what we want to animate.

39
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:09,830
OK, so this is basically by default it'll have the slide off, but when it's checked it'll run slide

40
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,250
on.

41
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:20,750
So let's set animation to slide on zero point three seconds, linear and forwards.

42
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,840
OK, so save that.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,460
And now since the first one is checked, you'll see that it's pushed over to the side.

44
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,340
If I reload this, they're all going to be unchecked.

45
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:38,990
But now if I click that, click that, that, and then if I click it again, it removes the checked

46
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:44,690
and it runs this, which is slide off, which brings it back over because of where we're setting it

47
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,310
on the x axis.

48
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,250
All right.

49
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,810
So we have that part done.

50
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:56,270
Now, the only thing we have left is the logic because we don't want to be able to say good, fast and

51
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,410
cheap, because that's very rare that you get that.

52
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,310
So we'll be able to do like cheap and good or cheap and fast.

53
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,010
So we'll add a little bit of JavaScript to this next.
