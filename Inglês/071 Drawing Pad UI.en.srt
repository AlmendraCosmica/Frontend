1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,960
OK, so we're going to get started on our drawing app and I'm just going to leave the browser a little

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:09,330
wider than usual just so we can fit the whole canvas in there because we wanted to be quite big since

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,700
it's a drawing area.

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:17,940
So for the title here, let's say drawing app, and we want to add our canvas element.

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,830
So it's a canvas.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,530
I'm going to give it an idea of canvas as well.

7
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,700
And basically this just allows us to have an area that we can use the canvas API on.

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:35,560
So in JavaScript we can draw shapes and lines and do all types of cool stuff.

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:43,030
Now I do want to give this a width and give it a width of 800 and height.

10
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,490
So we have 800 height.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,850
I might make that a little smaller later, but if I save that, we're not going to see anything.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:51,120
The canvas is there.

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,940
If we open up our elements tab and the dev tools, you can see if I highlight over canvas, we can see

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,730
the outline of it and you can add access to this, like we could say style.

15
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,600
You don't have to write, have to do this.

16
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,240
But just to show you, we could say like background red and save and now you can see the outline of

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,990
our canvas.

18
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:11,260
All right.

19
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,050
I'm just going to get rid of that.

20
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:17,670
Nothing is going to go inside those inside the canvas tags.

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:25,910
But what we do want is an area under the canvas to have our toolbox, which is going to be like where

22
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,360
we can increase and decrease the size of the pen and so on and change the color and clear it.

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:37,710
So let's create a divide with the class of toolbox here and in here will have a button.

24
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,470
So this button will have an idea of decrease.

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:51,160
And I'm just going to put a minus sign inside the entire text here and then under that will have a span.

26
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:54,390
And this is going to have an idea of size.

27
00:01:54,410 --> 00:02:00,170
So the initial size, I'm going to say 20 and then under that will have another button.

28
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,770
And this is going to have an idea of increase.

29
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,730
And inside here, we'll have a plus sign.

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,010
OK, we also want the color.

31
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,460
So let's say inputs.

32
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:13,130
And this is actually going to be a color input.

33
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,780
So each HTML5 has color inputs, so the type will be color.

34
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:18,350
We don't need the name.

35
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:21,190
The ID will also be color.

36
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,800
And then finally we want a button to clear it.

37
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,320
So say Button will give an idea of clear and I'm going to put an X inside of that.

38
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:30,860
All right.

39
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,900
So if I say that it's going to look like this, OK, now we're going to style and you can see the color

40
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,120
picker here, which is pretty cool.

41
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
It's just an HTML five input of color.

42
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,980
But let's jump into the stylesheet.

43
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,940
And surprisingly, we're not going to have to do too much here.

44
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,680
I'm going to keep the Roboto font.

45
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,200
Let's give the body a background color of light gray.

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,810
We'll do five, three times.

47
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:57,500
And then I want to get rid of overflow hidden case.

48
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,370
We have to scroll.

49
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:08,690
And that should do it for the body, for the canvas, so the canvas, I'm going to give a border, so

50
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,760
it's a border.

51
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,320
Let's do two pixels solid and I'm going to use steel blue.

52
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,240
Of course, you can use whatever color you want.

53
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,710
And then we have our toolbox, which has all the controls.

54
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:32,070
So for the toolbox, I'm going to set a background color of steel blue and I'm going to set a water.

55
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:41,940
Let's do border one pixel and solid and we'll use Slate Blue for that.

56
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,100
You can see that down here.

57
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,750
Now, I'm going to display this as a flex box so that everything inside of it are lined up as flex items.

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,170
And let's set a width of this.

59
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,040
I'm going to do a with of eight 04 pixels.

60
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:05,340
So that should just, you know, fill up the same with as the canvas and then padding.

61
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,370
Let's do one room padding like that.

62
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:15,240
Now, I want all of these controls here to have a just I want them to be in a big white box, everything.

63
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:23,820
So I want to take all of the direct children of Tool Box so we can target that with class toolbox and

64
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,890
we want the direct children.

65
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,550
Doesn't matter what the element is, button input, whatever span.

66
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:38,760
And let's set the background color to white and I'll just make this smaller so I can actually see.

67
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,370
So make the background color white.

68
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,960
Let's remove any border so border none.

69
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,250
And let's set them to display.

70
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:58,350
I'm going to use in my inline flex for the display and then we can a line item center and justify content

71
00:04:58,890 --> 00:04:59,530
center.

72
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,450
OK, so they're all in the same level and let's make the font size much bigger.

73
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,180
We're going to use two REM units.

74
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,910
OK, let's give it a fixed height and width of 50 pixels.

75
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:16,320
So height and with.

76
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,810
All right, let's add some margin will do points to five REM spaced him out a little bit.

77
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,100
Let's do padding and padding will be same thing.

78
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,480
Point to five REM.

79
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:42,480
And I think I think that's it, yeah, so we have all these boxes now, the last one to clear, I want

80
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,210
that to be set over here.

81
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:50,010
So what I can do to target that is, say, the direct children of Tool Box.

82
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,870
But I only want the last ones when you use the pseudo selector of the last Dasch child.

83
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:04,080
OK, so it's the last child element in the toolbox and I'm just going to set margin dash left to auto.

84
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:07,110
And if I do that now, it gets pushed over to the side.

85
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,470
All right, cool.

86
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,320
Let's actually add a pointer as well.

87
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,570
OK, so that's pretty much it for the interface.

88
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,580
And I mean, of course, you can make this is as big or small as you want, but we're going to go with

89
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,030
this.

90
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:29,730
And in the next video, we'll start on our JavaScript will get into canvas so that we can actually draw

91
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:32,610
on this and control the pen and all that.
