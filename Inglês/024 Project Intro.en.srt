00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,680
All right, welcome to your next project.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:09,130
So in this one, we're going to build a simple login form here with a wave effect on the labels.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,000
So if I go ahead and I click in here in the input, you can see the label will then wave up.

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,720
OK, so we have that cool little animation when we click in here and when we click out.

5
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,470
So basically the way we're going to do this is wrap a span around each one of these using JavaScript

6
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:30,630
and add a transition so that the label moves up when we focus on the input.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:34,020
But we're also going to add a dynamic transition delay.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,790
So it gives it that wave effect so each each letter goes up at a different time.

9
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,690
All right.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:40,880
So that's what we'll be doing.

11
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,360
Let's go ahead and get into it.
