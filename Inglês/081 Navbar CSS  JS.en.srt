1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,720
OK, so now we want to start on the Navar and I wanted to separate this out because, you know, the

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,110
website you're going to use this on in the future will be completely different.

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,260
So I want the Navar will be the same.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,890
So I wanted to do that all in one video.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,060
So let's go ahead and grab the nav tag.

6
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,550
OK, so that surrounds everything.

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:28,080
And I'm going to add a position to this, because right now you can see if I scroll it just you know,

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,340
it's just in the regular position and I can scroll out, you know, out of it.

9
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,520
So I want to position that fixed to the top as soon as I do that.

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,010
Now, no matter where I scroll, it's always going to be up at the top.

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,450
Now I'm going to set a background, let's do a background color and I'm going to do two, two, two

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:53,620
for the background color and I'm going to set the top.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,420
So it's going to be zero from the top and zero from both the left and the right, which is going to

14
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,060
make it go all the way across like that, OK?

15
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:11,850
And then we're going to want to add a transition here, because when we start to scroll, it's going

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,330
to change color and it's going to it's going to lessen the padding.

17
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,380
It's going to have that effect.

18
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,840
So we don't want that to just flicker in.

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,490
We want that to, you know, to add a smooth transition.

20
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:29,130
So we'll transition all elements or I'm sorry, all properties that can be transitioned in point three

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,650
seconds with an ease in our effect.

22
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,390
All right.

23
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:36,480
And then let's start to style some of this other stuff.

24
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:43,920
The container, basically, I want to put, you know, the logo on this side and the well on this side.

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:50,070
So the container is going to be the flex box because the H1 in the U.S. will be the flex items inside

26
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:50,360
of it.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,250
So if we look at our HTML, if I put the flex on now, then that's going to make the container the flex

28
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,420
item, which I don't want.

29
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,170
So I want this to be the flex box in these two to be the flex item.

30
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:11,640
So let's go right under that and do now have a container and set that to display flex, which automatically

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,120
is going to put the H1 in the U.S. side by side in a row.

32
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,710
And I want to basically take this space here and put it in between these so we can use justify content

33
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,580
space between and that will push that over to the side.

34
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:37,200
OK, I also want to align some or let's do a line items center which will center it, you know, this

35
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:37,620
way.

36
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,160
And then let's also add some padding.

37
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:48,450
Let's do 20 pixels top and bottom for the padding and we'll take care of this these list items in a

38
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,780
minute.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,120
OK, so we have that.

40
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:59,130
We're also going to add this transition onto the container because we're going to change the padding

41
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,690
value when we scroll and we add the active class.

42
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:11,400
Now for the U.S., you say NAV, you well, we want these items, the list items to be in a row.

43
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,930
So we'll display flex.

44
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,780
That'll automatically put them into a row.

45
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:16,800
We want to get rid of any bullet points.

46
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,710
So that's going to be set to none.

47
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,840
And let's line items to the center.

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:33,000
And that should be it will justify the center as well.

49
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,370
And then for the links.

50
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,920
So we have our actually, I, I just use NAV here.

51
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,040
We want to use the class of NAV because you might have a nav somewhere else, you know.

52
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,870
So next is the link.

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,600
So let's say class nav Maytag's.

54
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,980
I'm going to set the color to whites and let's get rid of that underline with text decoration none.

55
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:09,240
And let's spread these out so we'll do a padding of seven pixels, top and bottom, fifteen pixels left

56
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,360
and right that'll, you know, separate them out a bit.

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,990
And then I'm also going to add the transition.

58
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:21,030
I'm going to copy this and put that here as well.

59
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:30,700
All right, so, I mean, we have a sticky now, nav, pretty much all you have to do is is position

60
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,420
at fixed like this and it'll stick.

61
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:40,250
But we want to have that effect where when we hit a certain point, it turns white.

62
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,970
And it also has a little bit less padding.

63
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,200
OK, so when you scroll up and down and we'll give it that effect, so we're going to have a class of

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,920
active.

65
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:49,950
All right.

66
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,840
So let's say class now have class active.

67
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:04,600
So when it's active, I want the background color to be white and we can go ahead and add that right

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,340
here manually.

69
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,710
Let's just add active and now you can see it's white so we can at least see it in style it.

70
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,970
And then I'm also going to add let's make the links, the active links black.

71
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,420
So now active a set the color to black.

72
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:27,510
All right.

73
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:33,550
And then let's do let's add a box shadow when it's active as well.

74
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:46,790
So box shadow do for the offsets zero and two pixels, 10 pixel blur, Rajiva Black and zero point three

75
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,490
is just a little bit of box shadow.

76
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,650
Now the container, when it's active, I want to have less padding.

77
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,520
It has 20 to begin with.

78
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,770
So what I'll do is grab that.

79
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:03,730
And right here, let's say nav

80
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,850
active.

81
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:12,860
So the active nav container, I'm going to change it from twenty to ten pixels, right?

82
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:18,270
Now, if I say we can see it's skinnier and then I just want to have the hover, I want it to be ratified,

83
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,510
hover or if or if the link has a class of active.

84
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,030
In fact, maybe we should call it something different because we call this active so we can call it

85
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,620
current.

86
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:42,340
And then what we'll do is say NAV, if the A tag has a class of current or the nav a is being covered,

87
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:53,800
then let's make the color of this hexadecimal see zero three nine to be, which is a red color and we'll

88
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,130
make the font weight make that bold.

89
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:57,600
All right.

90
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:04,090
If I say we can see the current link, is that red color and if I hover, it's that red color and that's

91
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,760
going to be whether the Navar is white or black, active or not.

92
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,400
So I'm going to remove the active class on the NAV now goes back to being black.

93
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,800
So what the JavaScript is going to be used for is when we hit a certain point, when we scroll, we

94
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,470
want it to turn into the active nav bar.

95
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,220
Right.

96
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,170
So let's go to our JavaScript here.

97
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,870
And this isn't going to be difficult.

98
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,770
We're going to bring in our NAV.

99
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:35,770
So let's say Korn's now equals document dot query selector and will select it by the class of NAV.

100
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:42,640
And then we want to add on the window in event listener and we want to listen for a scroll.

101
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,840
And when we scroll, we're going to call a function called fixed nav.

102
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:53,720
OK, so down here, let's say function Fixx NAV loops no space.

103
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,740
So function fixed nav.

104
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,550
And we want to check the the scroll points.

105
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:07,450
So I'm just going to do a console log here of window dots and then scroll y because we're using we're

106
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,940
talking about the Y axis which is vertical.

107
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,560
So I'm going to open this up and as I scroll you can see it's going to give me that value.

108
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:25,040
And I also want to see the NAV element and check its offset height.

109
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:29,590
So if I scroll, you can see that the nav bars offset high.

110
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,500
It's seventy three and it's always going to it's going to stay seventy three.

111
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:39,130
But what we'll do, I want to figure out a point where we want to actually turn this into the active,

112
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,470
the active nav bar.

113
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,040
So what I'll do is actually do an if statement here.

114
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:55,780
So let's say if and we'll say if the scroll y position is greater than the nav offset height and we'll

115
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,520
just add one fifty to that.

116
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,650
So that's going to bring it down, you know, to to this area.

117
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:08,380
So if that's true, then let's take the nav and add the class.

118
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,070
So classless dot ad of active.

119
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,110
Right.

120
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,300
So we want to add active and else.

121
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,790
So if it's not if it's less than that then we want to remove the class.

122
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,600
So we'll just copy.

123
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:30,550
That and instead of ad, we're going to remove, all right, so I'll save that and now I'll start to

124
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,120
scroll.

125
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,960
And as soon as I hit this point where this is true, where it's the scroll, why value is greater than

126
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,870
the offset height plus one 150, then it turns to active.

127
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,370
OK, so it's going to take this height plus one, you know, 150.

128
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:56,710
So right around this point right here, OK, it's going to turn and if we go back up, it goes back

129
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:57,240
to normal.

130
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,500
So you see this effect a lot on Web sites and there's no need for Junqueira.

131
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,740
There's no need for any extra library.

132
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,010
It's very, very simple.

133
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:12,200
So you can use this for, you know, your Web sites and user interfaces from now on.

134
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,210
So that's it.

135
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,220
Hopefully this helps you out and, you know, gives you something you can use in the future.

136
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:19,190
And that's it.

137
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:19,950
Thanks for watching.

138
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,340
I'll see you in the next project.
