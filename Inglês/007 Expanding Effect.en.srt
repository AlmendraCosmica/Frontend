1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,000
OK, so now we want to get into the JavaScript, which is actually going to be fairly simple, and this

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,470
I plan on this being one of the first projects in at least in the first 10.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,940
So I'm going to explain kind of stuff that many of you might already know.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,270
Now, remember, the whole thing.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,120
What we need to do is just change the class really on each of these.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,870
So the first one has a class of active right now.

7
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:31,530
If I put that class on the second one, just manually by typing it in here, it's going to show the

8
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,180
second one.

9
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:35,760
So I'm going to start with that on the first like I had.

10
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,720
But we want to be able to switch that in our JavaScript.

11
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,320
So we need to first bring in all of these panels into the into our JavaScript files.

12
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,850
So I'm going to create a variable called panels and those different way to select elements we can use,

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,730
you know, get element by D, we can use query selector.

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:03,900
So a query selector does is allows us to select anything, could be, you know, a paragraph and each

15
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:10,170
one, a class, an ID, whatever we want the panels which have a class of panel.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,240
Now the problem here is there's more than one panel, right.

17
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,930
We have all these divs with panels, so we can't just do this or it's just going to select the first

18
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:19,220
one.

19
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,030
So we need to use query, select.

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,380
They're all in that case.

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,110
And with query, select, they're all instead of just selecting the element directly, it puts all of

22
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,690
the panels into what's called the node list, which is similar to an array.

23
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,740
In fact, I can show you that if I can.

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,390
So log here panels.

25
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,700
And we open up our chrome dev tools here, you'll see that it's going to it prints out this node list

26
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,740
with with each div and some properties, and I can target specific panels, like if I put zero in here

27
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,600
because arrays are zero index, it's going to give me the very first panel.

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,350
You can see it has a class of active, so I could get the second one with one and so on.

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,020
Now you can also loop through a no list, just like you can with an array.

30
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,830
And that's what I want to do.

31
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,420
I want to take my panels and use it for each, which is a high order array method.

32
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:19,130
And these methods take in a function as an argument so you could do a function or what you usually see

33
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,840
is an arrow function like this.

34
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:25,810
OK, and then we need to pass in here whatever we want to use for each iteration.

35
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,720
These are panels.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,430
So I'm going to use panel singular and I can console log here panel, and it's just going to loop through

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,730
and show me each panel.

38
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,340
Now, what do we actually want to do here?

39
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:45,410
We want to have an event listener on each of these so that if we click it, something happens.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,040
So we'll take each panel and say, add event listener and I want to listen for a click.

41
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,970
And when that click happens, we're going to run a function.

42
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,360
And for that function, let's just do a console log here and I'll just say, I don't know, one, two,

43
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:02,810
three.

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,060
And if I click on any of these, we're going to log one, two, three.

45
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,870
So I want to whatever when we click on I want to add a class of active.

46
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:20,180
So if I say panel dot class list, that gives me a list of the classes.

47
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:27,350
But we also have methods on this class, this object like add where we can specifically out of class

48
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,160
and I'm going to add a class of active.

49
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:36,800
So now if I just close this, if I click on this one, it gets added the class of active, which then

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,880
changes it to flex five if I click on this one same thing.

51
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,840
But you can see that active is still on these other ones.

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,690
So it's expanding them, but it's not it's not retracting the other ones.

53
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:58,640
So what we'll do is before we we put a class of active let's remove the class of active on all of the

54
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,390
other ones.

55
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:08,150
So I'm going to have a function here called Remove Active Classes, and we'll create that down here.

56
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,490
That's a function.

57
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,330
Remove active classes.

58
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,550
Now, since there's more than one panel, we again, we're going to loop through them and then remove

59
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,960
all the active classes.

60
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,260
So we're going to do just what we did above.

61
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:28,650
So panel dot for each and and here we'll put an arrow function.

62
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,290
Now, when you have an arrow function with just one argument like this, because we can also get the

63
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,110
index, we can get the the complete array.

64
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,600
But since we're only we only need this one panel.

65
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,200
We don't even need these curly sorry, these parentheses.

66
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,250
We can just do this.

67
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,530
All right.

68
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,340
And up here we can do the same thing.

69
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,280
I mean, you can keep them if you want, but you don't have to.

70
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:59,090
And then in here, let's say for the particular panel that we're looping through, we want on the class

71
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:05,150
list objects we want to call remove and we want to remove all the active classes.

72
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:13,640
OK, so now what's going to happen is when we click, it's going to remove all the active classes from

73
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,920
all of them and then put the active class on the one we click.

74
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,960
So if I click here,

75
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,980
looks like something a panel is not defined.

76
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,780
Oh, panels.

77
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,020
So we're looping through panels here, which is coming from here.

78
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,150
All right.

79
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,840
So if I click on this now, you'll see we get the effect that we want because right before it adds the

80
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,510
active class to this, it takes it off the rest of them.

81
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,810
Now, one thing I would like to change, though, is as soon as I click on this, you'll see the H3

82
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:51,350
and has that kind of weird falling down effect.

83
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,220
So let's add a transition to the opacity on the H3.

84
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:04,720
So I'm going to go to the active H3 and let's add a transition here and let's say opacity.

85
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:12,990
So we want to add a transition on the opacity, zero three point six zero point three seconds and ease

86
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:15,930
in and let's add a delay as well.

87
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,450
So we'll add zero point four seconds on the delay.

88
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:30,600
And now if I click, you see that it doesn't actually feed in until the until the card is fully expanded,

89
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,670
which is a lot smoother than it was before.

90
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,690
OK, so that's pretty much it, guys.

91
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,020
I mean, you can make these into any kind of card.

92
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,570
It doesn't have to be just a heading with a background image.

93
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,020
It could be like a testimonial or absolutely anything you want.

94
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:51,030
So hopefully this helps you in building further projects with little widgets like this.
