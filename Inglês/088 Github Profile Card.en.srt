1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,820
OK, so it started on our HTML and most of the stuff that we're going to do right now, the card with

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:11,670
the user info inside of it, that's going to ultimately come from JavaScript with the dynamic data from

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,590
the API after we fetch it.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:18,660
But for now, I'm just going to just type out the HTML, just hardcoded so we can at least see it and

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,300
style it.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,220
All right.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:31,470
So for the title here, it's a GitHub profiles and then down here let's create a form.

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:37,400
And this form is going to have a class of user form and it's going to have an idea of form.

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,660
We don't need an action.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:51,390
OK, and then inside this form, we're going to have a single input and give it an idea of search and

11
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,740
let's add a placeholder.

12
00:00:54,990 --> 00:01:03,570
And for the placeholder, we'll say search a GitHub user, save that.

13
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,850
We have an input here and I'm not going to put a submit button.

14
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,990
We're just going to type the user in and enter.

15
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:17,670
You can add a submit button if you want, and then let's go underneath the form and we're going to use

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,740
the HTML five main tag and give us an idea of Maine.

17
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,370
Now, ultimately, this is all we're going to have in our HTML.

18
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,890
Whatever the card, the user profile card is going to get inserted in here by the JavaScript.

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,680
But like I said, for now, we're just going to type it out so we can see it in style it.

20
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:43,410
So we want a class of card and in that class will have a div with an image inside with a class of avatar.

21
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,320
And I'm just going to put up a dummy image from the random user API.

22
00:01:49,320 --> 00:02:01,170
So we'll say random user dot me slash API slash portrait's slash and I'm just going to use men slash

23
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,420
30 dot jpeg.

24
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,750
Now that you just give us a random user of some guy now under the stiv here.

25
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,510
So card we're going to use flex box to align it.

26
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,060
This will be the first flexitime and then we'll have another div with the class of user info with all

27
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,930
the user's info such as the user name which will put in an H2.

28
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:29,910
For now I'm just going to say John Doe and then a bio which right now just do LAAM 10, some dummy text

29
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:37,050
in there and then under the paragraph, under the bio we want a little and let's do a list item.

30
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,390
So this will be like the number of followers, we'll say three hundred and then put some strong tags

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,080
in and say followers and I'm just going to copy that down twice.

32
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,800
This one here is going to be following the following will say one hundred and then this will be the

33
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:04,170
number of repos, say thirty three posts and then under the rule will have the actual repositories of

34
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,590
the user.

35
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,990
We're going to get the latest five repositories.

36
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:09,450
So let's have an idea of repose here.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:18,120
And then each one is just going to be a link with the class of repos and then the text they'll just

38
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,780
say Rebo one and we'll just do three.

39
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,870
And that's it for the HTML.

40
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,460
So it's going to look like this so far.

41
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:31,440
So let's start to style this as far as the eye can make this smaller.

42
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,720
Now, as far as the font goes, we're going to use a font called Poppins.

43
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:45,060
So I'm going to just replace Raboteau with Poppins and the wait, let's do two hundred and four hundred

44
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,220
and change the family down here to Poppins.

45
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,660
OK, and then let's see, we're going to add a background color.

46
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:11,090
What else do we want to use hexadecimal value to a two and then a seven two, so it's a dark blue and

47
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,960
then we'll make the color of the text white.

48
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,100
All right.

49
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,010
And then let's see for this stuff.

50
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,090
This is all good.

51
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:24,620
Yeah, we'll just keep the rest of the body stuff here.

52
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,530
So the user form.

53
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:37,850
For that, I want to just set the set a width of one hundred percent so it goes all the way across its

54
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,250
container and this is the form, not the input.

55
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:47,900
And then I'm going to set a max width of 700 pixels.

56
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:49,930
All right.

57
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:56,180
And then for the input, experts say user form input.

58
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:03,200
What set the width of that to be 100 percent?

59
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:07,460
And we want to style this to look a lot better.

60
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:15,590
I'm going to also display it as a block level elements and then let's set a background color to the

61
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,070
input.

62
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,080
And that's going to be for C two eight eight five.

63
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,060
So like a purplish color, let's take away the border.

64
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,400
So say border none.

65
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,650
And let's set a border radius and we'll do 10 pixels on that.

66
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,630
OK, let's make the color white.

67
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,910
And let's make the let's give it some padding, so I'm just I'm going to use Rhim units here.

68
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:54,720
So one room, which is just a multiplier of the root HTML element, which by default is 16 pixels.

69
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,870
So we're just saying padding 16 pixels right now.

70
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,100
All right.

71
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:04,320
And then I just want to add a margin bottom for that I'm going to use to RAM, which in this case will

72
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,610
be 32 pixels.

73
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:17,660
And let's set the font family to inherit and let's set the font size to be bigger than that.

74
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,170
I'm just going to set it to one ram.

75
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:27,170
And let's add a box shadow or a couple of box shadows, and I'm just going to pace this in.

76
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,260
OK, so our first shadow here with the offsets, the blur and the color.

77
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,910
And then we have our second shadow here.

78
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,490
All right.

79
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,080
And then if I click inside of it, we get this outline, which I don't want to keep.

80
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:55,410
So let's use our dash form input and then Colen focus and then we want to set the outline to none.

81
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:58,430
All right.

82
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,330
And let's also make the placeholder white.

83
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,330
So if you want to change the color of a placeholder, we can say user form input and then Kalanchoe

84
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:15,630
and placeholder and let's say color and we'll set that to hexadecimal triple B, so make it a little

85
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,050
lighter.

86
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,020
All right, now let's work on the card, which is around all of the rest of this.

87
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,450
So class card.

88
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:35,330
And for this let's set a max width of 800 pixels and we are going to make this responsive as well.

89
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,280
And then the background color.

90
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,530
Let's set that to four C two eight eight five.

91
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,610
So it's the same as the input background.

92
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:54,510
And let's set the border radius to 20 pixels.

93
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:05,240
All right, and then let's add a box shadow for this as well, so I'm actually going to copy this.

94
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,590
OK, we're going to use the same box shadow is that.

95
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:13,150
Good.

96
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:18,520
And then after that, let's display everything as a floral display.

97
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,590
This is a flex box.

98
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:25,800
So the two items inside are the image, the div with the image and then the user info div that has everything

99
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,360
else in it.

100
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:38,010
So I'm going to set padding on the card to three ram and let's set margin to zero top and bottom.

101
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,130
Let's do one point five ram on the left and right.

102
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,910
So that pushes it in a little bit.

103
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:43,830
All right.

104
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,630
So it doesn't go any further than that.

105
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,410
And we will add a media query to kind of stack those rows.

106
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,290
I'm sorry, those columns as well.

107
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,670
But let's go ahead and work on the avatar so we have a class of avatar.

108
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,700
I want this to be rounded with a border.

109
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:10,380
So set the border radius to 50 percent and then let's set the border.

110
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:19,620
Going to give it a quite thick border, 10 pixels solid, and then the color will be to a to a seven

111
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:30,750
to and let's give it a height of 150 pixels and we'll do a width of 150 as well.

112
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:37,790
And now we have the user info, which is all of this over here.

113
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:48,390
So let's take the user info class and I'm going to set the color of the text to triple E.

114
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:55,290
And just add a little bit of margin left to bring it away from the image, so I'm going to use to ram

115
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,480
units here, so push that away, the H2.

116
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,880
So user info H2, we're going to get rid of any margin on the top.

117
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,310
So margin top zero and for the U.S. to.

118
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:27,440
For the URL, I'm going to display flaks, and this is this right here, so I'm going to display Flex

119
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,630
and actually let's take away any bullet points or style type.

120
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,170
We're going to set that to none and then display flex and the we want to justify the content.

121
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,000
So this is the horizontal spacing.

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,140
We're going to set the space between the elements like that and just get rid of any padding.

123
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:59,050
And let's set a max width on this to 400 pixels now for the list item.

124
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:09,510
So these right here, let's grab this and say for the allies, I'm going to display flaks.

125
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:17,430
And also I want to just align items to center on the cross access.

126
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,190
And then for the strong tag, the number is right next to the text here.

127
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:29,780
So let's grab actually, we'll just grab this and save for the strong tags.

128
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:40,530
I'm going to set the font size to zero point nine REM and then let's also move it over a bit.

129
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,970
So the margin left.

130
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,560
I'll use zero point five REM.

131
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,500
All right, good.

132
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:51,950
Now, the repos down here, obviously you need to style those.

133
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,480
So let's take the class of repo.

134
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,810
So all all of those links have a class of rebo.

135
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,410
Let's get rid of the underlying subtext decoration.

136
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:01,800
None.

137
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:05,880
And let's set the color of these two white.

138
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:19,070
And I'm also going to set a background color to to a to a seven to oops and what happened there and

139
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,400
why.

140
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,510
Why isn't this working?

141
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,330
Oh yeah.

142
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,760
These should be rebo.

143
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:27,610
All right.

144
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,940
So we have our background color.

145
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,440
Let's do font size and font size.

146
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,460
I'm going to stick to zero point seven REM.

147
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:44,410
So make those smaller and then let's add some padding and you don't have to use REM units.

148
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,270
I just we just wanted to kind of change things up a bit.

149
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:54,560
So we're going to do point to five REM top and bottom and then zero point five REM left and right.

150
00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:09,680
OK, and then let's set the margin or set margin right to zero point five REM and let's do margin bottom

151
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:18,250
zero point five REM, just in case the Repos go on to the next line and think that's it.

152
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:27,170
Let's display as an inline block instead of inline and ultimately you'll be able to click on these and

153
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,880
go to the the Repos.

154
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,520
But that's pretty much it.

155
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:35,810
Now, I do want to make this more responsive because, you know, if it's on really small screens,

156
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,180
it's going to look kind of weird.

157
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:46,760
So I'm just going to add a media query here so we'll see media with the max width of I'm going to do

158
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,050
500 pixels.

159
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,470
So if it's under 500 pixels, let's take the card.

160
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,570
And it's displayed flex, but it's a flex row, meaning it goes horizontal.

161
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:00,160
Let's change the flex direction to a column.

162
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:05,330
If I do that, it's going to put the two elements, the two flex items on top of each other.

163
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:11,530
And then let's just align to the middle so we can align items to the center.

164
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,060
OK, so that looks pretty good.

165
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,020
And the form let's take the user form.

166
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:23,540
And initially I think it has a max width of 800 pixels.

167
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,300
So I'm going to set it Max with a four hundred pixels.

168
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,970
OK, so I think that looks pretty good.

169
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,350
So now it is responsive.

170
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,200
So in the next video we obviously want to make this function so we can reach out to the GitHub API and

171
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,220
fetch a user and we're actually going to use axios, which is an HTTP library, as opposed to using

172
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:48,350
fetch which is built into the browser.
