1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,270
OK, so this is a very useful but simple project, so we can probably get this done in one video.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:08,790
So let's jump into our project starter here.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:16,770
And for the title, I'm going to just call this scroll animation and we're going to go down here into

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,310
the body.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,880
And all we really need is a bunch of boxes which would ultimately contain your website content.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,750
We're going we're not going to waste time creating content.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,530
We're just going to have a bunch of boxes and then apply the animation to them.

8
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:40,710
I am just going to put an H1 here and say scroll to see the animation and then under that will have

9
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,480
a class of box.

10
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:48,850
And I'm just going to put an H2 with the word content and we'll just copy this down.

11
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,950
We'll have a bunch of these.

12
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:58,080
Now, ultimately, like I said, you would have these would be cards or just sections of your website,

13
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,440
whatever it is that you want to bring in with that slide animation.

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:10,090
So let's go into our style sheet here and I'm going to add a background color.

15
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:25,720
And let's make that hexadecimal e f f e d six to kind of a tannish background and then let's do C display

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,760
flex justified direction.

17
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,610
OK, so that's good.

18
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,870
I'm going to get rid of the height and the overflow hidden because we do want a scroll bar.

19
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,560
Obviously this is a scrolling animation.

20
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:49,410
And then for the H1 when it's just set margin to 10 pixels and then let's create the style for the boxes.

21
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:56,410
So I'm going to use a background color of steel blue to make the text color white.

22
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:04,840
And I'm going to display Flex because I just want to align the H2 that's inside to the center, both

23
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,340
horizontally and vertically.

24
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,270
So display flex line items center and justify content center.

25
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:22,450
And let's set a width of 400 hundred pixels on the box and let's do a height of two hundred pixels.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,570
OK, we want to separate them out.

27
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:31,090
So let's do a margin of 10 pixels and let's do a border radius.

28
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,900
So what a radius will do 10 pixels and let's add a little box shadow.

29
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,840
Obviously this stuff isn't needed, but I just want to make it look decent.

30
00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:49,690
So don't two pixels and four pixels for the offsets, five pixels for the blur, RGB for the color,

31
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,860
which is going to be zero zero zero zero point three for the alpha value.

32
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:00,370
And then for the animation, we're going to use the transform property with translate X, because that's

33
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,600
what we want to do, is move these along the X axis.

34
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:11,980
So initially, let's set box the class of box transform and we want to set the translate.

35
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,520
Why?

36
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,940
I mean, I'm sorry, translate X, which is horizontal.

37
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,170
It's the X axis.

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:24,430
Those of you want my semicolon in here and I'm going to set this to two.

39
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,870
So zero is the default.

40
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,700
If I set it to zero, there's no change.

41
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:35,050
If I set it to, let's say, 100 pixels and say you can see it gets moved over one hundred pixels gets

42
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,170
moved over to the right.

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,300
So what I'm going to do is set this to two hundred percent, which is going to move it way off the screen

44
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,530
to the right.

45
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:52,390
And then what's going to happen is if we have the class of show, so let's say box with the class of

46
00:03:52,390 --> 00:04:01,150
show, then we're going to set the transform and translate why I translate X to zero, which is the

47
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,800
default.

48
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:07,990
So if I go over here and I apply a class of show to this first one, it's going to show because it's

49
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:12,310
in the regular position, the rest of them are still two hundred percent over here.

50
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:20,650
And then what we'll do is we'll have a transition so that when that class gets added, it transitions

51
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:23,110
in smoothly from over here.

52
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,310
All right.

53
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,360
So we want to add a transition on the transform property.

54
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,800
We'll do a zero point four second duration with an EZ effect.

55
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:41,740
OK, now the way it is now, if we add the JavaScript and we add the scroll functionality and they come

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,260
in, they're all going to come in from this side.

57
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,960
I actually want every other one to come in from the from different sides.

58
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:59,110
So what we can do is right here, let's take our box class and let's use anthe of type, which is a

59
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:04,870
pseudo selector, and we can select all of the even elements, all the even boxes.

60
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,230
OK, so basically, you know, every other one.

61
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:16,720
And what we'll do is instead of setting the initial, the initial transform translate X to two hundred

62
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,400
percent, we're going to set it to negative two hundred percent, which is going to put OK, put them

63
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,120
over here.

64
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,190
So all the even ones are now over here, all the odd ones are on this side.

65
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,740
OK, and then when we have them come in, when we dynamically add the class of show, they're going

66
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,270
to come in from different sides.

67
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,620
All right.

68
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:42,480
And we have to also figure out where we when we want them to come in as we scroll.

69
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,390
So that should do it for the success.

70
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,700
Actually, I just want to make the H2 a little bigger.

71
00:05:48,700 --> 00:06:00,940
So let's say box to set the font size to forty five pixels and then we'll jump into our JavaScript and

72
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,370
first thing we want to do is bring in our boxes.

73
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,240
So let's say const boxes and document dot query.

74
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,320
We want query selector all because there's more than one.

75
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:19,920
So this will put it into an array or a node list, and then we want to fire off an event when we scroll.

76
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,870
So on the window, we're going to add an event listener of scroll.

77
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,910
And when that happens, we'll have a function called checkboxes because we want to check the positioning

78
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,930
of each box and a box could be anything.

79
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,440
It could be any section of your website or an image or whatever.

80
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:52,410
So we're going to have this function checkboxes and we need to figure out where is the trigger point?

81
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,940
Where do we want when we're scrolling down, where do we want them to start to come in?

82
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,430
So we're going to be using window dot in our height.

83
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,100
In fact, we can just console log.

84
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:15,250
That so you can see and we're going to run checkboxes to begin with anyways right here, so we'll go

85
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:15,990
ahead and run that.

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,690
And then if I open this up, you'll see Eighty-eight is the window height, not counting the console.

87
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,680
If I move this console up and I reload now that the height is four or six.

88
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,690
So we're getting the inner height and we want the trigger point.

89
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:38,620
So basically where we want you know, it's a it's a scroll in, we're going to want that to be a little

90
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,810
less than the inner height.

91
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,040
And and we can't just use a fixed number because the height could be, you know, different on at any

92
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,800
at any point.

93
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:57,270
So what we're going to do is divide this by five and then multiply it by four.

94
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:03,790
So now we just reload this so you can see the height here is 666.

95
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,550
If I save that now, this gives us this equation here, gives us five thirty two.

96
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:10,900
All right.

97
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,570
So that's going to be our trigger point.

98
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,910
So I'm actually going to put this into a variable.

99
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,700
We'll call it trigger bottom.

100
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,310
So where in the in the window do we want to trigger?

101
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,110
So we have that now.

102
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:35,680
Let's go ahead and take our boxes, which we brought in, which is a no list that we can loop through.

103
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,700
And we'll save for each box.

104
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,390
Yeah, for each box.

105
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:52,500
Let's get the top of the box, and when I say box, you know, I mean this the elements here, so consed

106
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:59,580
box top, I'm going to set this to the the whatever box we're dealing with because remember, we're

107
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:07,650
looping through them and we there's this method called get bounding client wrecked.

108
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:11,760
So I actually have this I want to show you this real quick

109
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,060
just so you understand what this does.

110
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:26,940
So this method returns with what's called the Dom ract object, and it's just basically a rectangle

111
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,780
described as the size and position of a rectangle.

112
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:36,420
So it returns that providing information about the size of an element and its position relative to the

113
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,020
viewport.

114
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,790
So where in the viewport is it?

115
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,940
And there's a bunch of properties that we can use on this.

116
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:47,640
If we go down here, we have the x y width height where it is, where the top of it is, where the right,

117
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,430
where the bottom, where the left of it is.

118
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,700
So we want to see where the top of that particular box is.

119
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,070
So we're going to add here dot top.

120
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,970
OK, so that will give us the top value.

121
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:09,810
And then all we need to do after that is see if the top of the box is less than the trigger bottom.

122
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,900
If it is, we want to add the class of show.

123
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,490
If it's not, if it's more than we want to remove the class of show.

124
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:31,200
So let's say if the box top is less than the trigger bottom, then let's take that box and let's add

125
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,420
a class or classless list, add of show or else then we want to remove it.

126
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,670
So box stock class list.

127
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,350
Dot remove show.

128
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:59,360
OK, so now I'm going to go and just remove this show that we added manually, now notice that it's

129
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,280
only showing the first three because those are in range.

130
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:07,660
Now, when we start to scroll, it's going to fire off an event.

131
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,210
And the reason we see these come in initially is because of this right here.

132
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:15,670
If we don't have that, we're not going to see them because it hasn't this hasn't fired off yet.

133
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,940
If I scroll, it does.

134
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,950
I mean, if you want that functionality where it doesn't show it until you scroll, that's fine.

135
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,320
But usually you would show everything above the fold.

136
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,760
So we run that initially first, then we start to scroll.

137
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:35,060
And as soon as this is true, as soon as the top of the next box is less than the trigger bottom point,

138
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:40,610
which is a little less than the, you know, the entire height of the viewport, it's going to come

139
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,970
in because it adds that class of show.

140
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,970
And what that class of show does is sets it to its normal position.

141
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:55,100
Now, if it's even if it's starts over here, so it comes in from that way, if it's not even it starts

142
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,080
over here and comes in from that way.

143
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,990
So every other one comes in from a different direction.

144
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:05,830
And as we scroll up, it's still going to fire off this event and it's still going to check this.

145
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,280
So if this is not true, it'll remove the class.

146
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,700
So as we scroll up, you'll see that they'll start to go out.

147
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,860
Now, one thing I just noticed is I do have a horizontal scroll bar here and I don't want that.

148
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:33,560
So in my success, I'll just add on to the body here and I'll say overflow, overflow X, because this

149
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,660
is the X axis scrollbar.

150
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,350
We're going to set that to hidden so that we'll get rid of that horizontal scrollbar.

151
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,570
All right.

152
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,490
So pretty easy.

153
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:49,580
And I mean, a lot of people use Shakeri for something like this or a library like Animate on scroll.

154
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,130
Animate on scroll is actually a really cool library.

155
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:55,850
And if you want to do some funky stuff, then you can use that.

156
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:01,640
But I mean, if it's just something simple and you're just bringing in elements when you scroll down,

157
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,680
this is very lightweight.

158
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,520
You know, no extra libraries or anything and it's really easy to do so.

159
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,180
Hopefully you guys found this useful and I'll see you in the next project.
