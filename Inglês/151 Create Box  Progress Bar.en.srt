1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,310
OK, so we're going to get started on our testimonial box, I'm going to keep this the browser pretty

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:09,270
wide just so we can see the whole thing at at a at a wider width.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,920
So in the HTML here, I just have a link to font.

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,490
Awesome.

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,900
And you can get that if you go to CDN, NJ Ask.com, just search for font.

6
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,530
Awesome.

7
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:20,580
Or just go to the font.

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:30,840
Awesome Web site, grab the CDN link and then let's change the title here to a testimonial box and down

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,670
here I'll get rid of this H1.

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,260
So this is going to be the container.

11
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:38,370
So testimonial Dasch container

12
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,140
and we want we're going to have a progress bar.

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,630
So I'm going to add that here.

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,600
So just progress dash bar, nothing inside the div.

15
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,800
That's where the animated line progress bar is going to go.

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,690
And then we want our quotes.

17
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,240
So I'm going to give us a class of eFax for fun.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:57,720
Awesome.

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:02,190
And I want a dash quote dash.

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,000
Right.

21
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,580
But I'm also going to give it just a class of F a quote and I'm going to add that to both of them.

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,840
So let's copy that down and let's make this left.

23
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,640
And if I save that, we'll just going to see our two quotes right here.

24
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,950
So under the quotes, we'll have a paragraph with the class of testimonial.

25
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,410
And obviously this is going to be dynamic.

26
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,960
But for now, I'm just going to paste in some text so you can put whatever you like here or you can

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,220
just get that this exact text from from the repository.

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,150
All right.

29
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,380
And then under the paragraph, we're going to have a user class, which is going to have the user stuff

30
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,190
like the image.

31
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,840
So let's say image.

32
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,170
I'll give this a class of user das dash image.

33
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,260
And for the image, I'm going to take it from this random user.

34
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:00,900
So random user dot me slash API slash portraits

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:09,420
and let's do slash woman slash forty six jpeg.

36
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,540
So just give us a random image of a woman and then also I'm just going to say user.

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,620
All right.

38
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:26,790
So I save that every go now under the image we're going to have the user details so we'll have a class

39
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:33,810
of user details and then I'll have an H for and I'm going to give this a class of user name and we're

40
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:41,310
going to say my miles and then a paragraph with the class of role.

41
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,890
And her role is going to be marketing.

42
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:44,970
And that's it.

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,050
That's all the HTML.

44
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,980
So pretty simple.

45
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,340
Let's jump into the stylesheet here.

46
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:56,160
Now, I'm not going to use the Raboteau font with this, so I want to get rid of everything up to success.

47
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,430
And then from here we'll do questionmark and set the family equal to.

48
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,730
And I'm going to use what font to my using here.

49
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:16,950
Monserrat So M0 and T s e r a t and I'm just going to grab that font and put that right here for the

50
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:17,460
body.

51
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,550
K changes the font up.

52
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:26,850
I'm going to add a slightly light gray or slightly darker background color with the light gray.

53
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:33,240
So let's do it for three times and display flex.

54
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,440
We want everything centered.

55
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,340
That's correct.

56
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,740
Height 100 viewport heights because we want it centered both horizontally and vertically.

57
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,140
And then I'm just going to do padding ten pixels just so when it's on smaller screens.

58
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,470
We have a little bit of, you know, Rome on the edge here.

59
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:56,790
So this is the testimonial container wraps around everything Sloots style that we can actually make

60
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:57,660
this smaller.

61
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,420
Yeah, so let's do the testimonial container.

62
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,340
So for this, let's set the background color.

63
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:21,930
I'm going to set it to a hexadecimal blue, which is four, seven, six, C four, and will set the

64
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,780
color to be white.

65
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,900
And let's set the border radius rounded corners.

66
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:38,970
So I'm going to set this to, let's say, 15 pixels and let's do margin, 20 pixels, top and bottom.

67
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,200
Auto left and right.

68
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,660
Padding is going to be 50, top and bottom 80, 80 left and right.

69
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,680
And then let's give it a max with as well.

70
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,910
So, Max, what I'm going to do 768.

71
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:06,420
Yeah, and then I'm going to position it relative, because the quotes inside, I want to position those

72
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,570
absolute because I want the quotes like one here and one here.

73
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,690
So let's actually do that next.

74
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,540
So we have a dash quote is on both quotes, so I'll give those a color.

75
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,530
I want them to be kind of transparent looking.

76
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,750
So we'll do our Giba White.

77
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:30,090
So 255 for red, green, blue and then zero point three for the alpha because at that transparent type

78
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,540
look and then font size.

79
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,980
So let's make it bigger to twenty pixels.

80
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,420
Right.

81
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:43,680
And then we're going to position these to be absolute and let's set from the top 70 pixels.

82
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,030
So if I save that, both of them are going to be in the same exact spot.

83
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,420
So what we'll do is we'll first grab the right kwoh.

84
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,250
So F.A.A. quote dash.

85
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:53,880
Right.

86
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,420
And let's set that position from the left.

87
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,750
Forty pixels, which is going to move it over here.

88
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:07,110
Now this one, I want to be on the other side, so I'll just copy this down and let's set this quote

89
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:10,560
left and we want to go from the right.

90
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,660
Forty pixels.

91
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,120
Good.

92
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:22,980
Now if it's if the screen is smaller, like, you know, if it's around, if it's if it's under seventy

93
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,980
seven, sixty eight, then let's remove the quote.

94
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:32,760
So what we'll do is just add a media query down here by doing at media and inside here we want to set

95
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:42,390
the max with to seven sixty eight pixels, meaning that these styles are only going to apply if it's

96
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,550
under 768 pixels.

97
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:51,760
And we'll take the FAA dash quotes and display none.

98
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,890
OK, so if it's smaller than that, it's going to display none.

99
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:00,960
I'm also going to lessen the padding on the container if it's smaller like this.

100
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:06,210
So let's take the testimonial container and set the padding.

101
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:12,750
I believe it was fifty to twenty pixels, top and bottom and thirty left and right.

102
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:13,620
There we go.

103
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:24,100
All right, so let's move on from the quotes I want to go back above the media query here and we have

104
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,860
the testimonial, which is that the paragraph?

105
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,010
So it's a testimonial.

106
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:39,300
And I just want to change the line right here to 28 pixels just to spread the lines apart.

107
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:45,430
And as far as the text line, let's do justify like that.

108
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:57,240
OK, now for the user section here, say user, and I'm going to display as flex box and I want to center

109
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:05,820
everything, so I'm going to align items center and also justify content center.

110
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:16,760
All right, now for the image we have, the user image shows a user user image, and I want this to

111
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,620
be circular.

112
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:26,000
So I'm going to do a border radius of 50 percent to make it circular, a rounded and let's set the height

113
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,720
and the width to let's do seventy five pixels.

114
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:38,870
So that'll be the height and width, make it a little smaller and I'm just going to set object fit to

115
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:43,310
cover, which we actually don't need to have that.

116
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:50,030
But just to make sure it covers the back, the, not the background image but the, the image itself

117
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,550
and then user details.

118
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:56,900
So it's a user user details.

119
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,740
I'm just going to add margin yellows to margin left 10 pixels.

120
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,210
So this right here, we just want some spacing in between these.

121
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,700
Here are, you know, this these are pretty far apart.

122
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,720
So the user name, I believe is an H four.

123
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:21,290
So let's take the user name and let's remove any padding from it.

124
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,350
So I'm sorry, margin, remove any margin from it.

125
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:38,330
And then for the role of, say, user roll, I'm going to set the font weight to make sure the font

126
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,560
weight is set to normal and let's set margin.

127
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,640
We'll do two pixels on the top and bottom zero on the left and right.

128
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,650
Actually, that's kind of close together.

129
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:49,850
So it's to.

130
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,330
It's to 10.

131
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,120
Yeah, it's fine.

132
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:05,220
So the progress bar right now is just it's an empty divx, that's where we're going to have the animated

133
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,760
line.

134
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,580
So let's style the progress bar.

135
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:20,840
I'm going to give it a background of white background, color of white, and then let's give it a height

136
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,970
of, let's say, four pixels.

137
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,410
Now we can see the line, the width, make sure it's 100 percent.

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,950
And then we're going to have an animation called Grow.

139
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,400
We haven't created that yet, but we will it's going to take 10 seconds.

140
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:44,210
OK, so this is important because when we write our JavaScript, we want the box to change every 10

141
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:45,220
seconds as well.

142
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:52,910
So we want this progress bar to take 10 seconds to grow and we want it to grow in a linear style and

143
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:57,940
infinite so that it repeats and that should do it.

144
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,100
We just need to create that animation.

145
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,490
So let's create that in a key frame.

146
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,790
So the key frames and call this grow.

147
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,060
And this is going to be pretty simple.

148
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:18,820
We're just going to say at zero percent, we want to add a transform property and we want to scale X,

149
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,870
so it's going horizontal.

150
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,630
So X and set that to zero.

151
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,070
So now if I save, that's not right.

152
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,810
That's coming from the middle.

153
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:35,330
So we can actually change that by adding a transform origin up here.

154
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,700
So transform origin.

155
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,250
I'm going to set that to left.

156
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:39,470
There we go.

157
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,040
So that gives it, you know, positions it differently.

158
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,270
If we could also do right.

159
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,770
If you wanted to go that way.

160
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,270
But yeah, we're going to set that to left.

161
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,840
So that takes 10 seconds total to get to the end here, which is what we want.

162
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,000
So in the next video, we're going to jump into the JavaScript.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,690
And as soon as it hits the end, you can see right now it just doesn't do anything.

164
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:00,730
It just starts over.

165
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,540
We want the testimonial.

166
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,480
We want the content to change.

167
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,720
So we need to use JavaScript to to manipulate the DOM.

168
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,250
All right.

169
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,250
So we'll do that next.
