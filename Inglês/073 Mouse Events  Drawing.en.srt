1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,630
OK, so we have a couple of functions here to draw a circle, draw a line, and I'm not calling them

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,010
anywhere just yet, but we want to start to deal with our most events.

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:19,260
So ultimately, we want to be able to hold up our most buttoned down and drag and draw based on the

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,150
color selected based on the, you know, the line selected or the with whatever you want to call that

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:24,880
the size.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,110
So let's go above our functions here and let's take our canvas.

7
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:40,320
So we're going to take our canvas and add an event listener and I'm going to listen for a most down

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,180
event.

9
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:48,870
So basically when I click and I hold it down, that'll be a down and we're going to pass in our event

10
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,830
object here.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,690
And I'm going to have another global variable up here and undersize.

12
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,300
And we're going to call this is Prest because we want to know if the mouse is being pressed and that's

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,010
going to be false to begin with.

14
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,470
But once we have mouse down, we'll say is pressed is then going to equal.

15
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,130
True.

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,520
I also want to get the position of where the mouse is, and that's what these X and Y values are.

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:24,680
So let's set X here to dot offset X and then we'll set Y to idot offset Y, OK?

18
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,820
And that will give us the positioning of where the mouse is.

19
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,640
In fact, I'll go ahead and console log.

20
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:41,640
Let's log is pressed and let's log X and Y so I'll go over here and I'll open up my console.

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:49,220
Just reload that and you'll see we get true because when I most down it's true.

22
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,630
And then the position where I clicked.

23
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,230
All right, so if I go, if I go up here, I can see it's a very low number.

24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,350
The top is cut off because of my console.

25
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,740
But you can see if I click all the way over here, it's like one, right?

26
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,930
If I click outside of the canvas, nothing happens.

27
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:13,550
But if I click right on the edge that said negative zero.

28
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,150
So one, as they go over, you can see that first number climb.

29
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,580
As they go down, you can see the second number climb.

30
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,510
OK, so that's our X and Y positioning and is pressed is true.

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,350
Now when we release I want is to be false and I want to clear these values.

32
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:39,330
So I'm just going to copy this and I want to change this now to mouse up.

33
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,010
So that's on release.

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,570
We're going to set is press to false and then we're going to set X and Y just equal to undefined.

35
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:57,970
So sets that to undefined and will console Lorgat there as well.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,300
So if I go, I'm going to click and hold true and that gives me the positioning I'm going to let go.

37
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,220
I get false and the positioning is undefined.

38
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,290
OK, so that's what I want.

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,520
I'm just going to get rid of the console logs because we don't need those anymore.

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,110
But now it knows if we're if we're holding it down or if the mouse isn't being pressed.

41
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,260
Now, we want an event for mouse move.

42
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:27,610
So just copy this real quick and let's set this to mouse move right now.

43
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,360
Mouse move.

44
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:36,430
We can get the positioning, but we only want any of this to happen if the mouse is being pressed.

45
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:41,470
So let's do an F here and let's say if is pressed.

46
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:47,890
Hey, so if that's true, it means we're holding it down, then let's create a variable here called

47
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,370
X2 and set it to the positioning.

48
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:57,370
So E dot offset X and then do the same thing for Y.

49
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,980
This will be called Y two.

50
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,830
All right.

51
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:08,380
And we can go ahead and console log this X to and Y to.

52
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:16,810
And now if I go and I click and hold, you can see the position of wherever my mouse is now instead

53
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,450
of console logging, I actually want to draw.

54
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,180
So I'm going to call, draw circle.

55
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:30,030
And what's going to go in here is that the position, the X two and the Y two.

56
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,680
Now if we save that, we come over here.

57
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm just going to close up the console.

58
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,900
Now, if I click and I hold, what's going to happen is it keeps drawing circles, OK?

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,740
So every time I move the mouse, it we get the values of the position.

60
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,360
We passman to draw a circle and it draws a circle.

61
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:53,920
Now the problem we have is if I go really fast, you can see that there's, you know, spaces in between

62
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,180
the circles and we don't want that.

63
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,580
We want just a straight line no matter what.

64
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:05,550
So in addition to draw a circle, we're going to draw a line or just copy that down and say draw a line.

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,930
Now, this is going to be where we draw the line, but we need that.

66
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:12,370
We need to add the move to positions as well.

67
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,130
So this move to is the first two arguments passed in which is going to be X and Y.

68
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,610
OK, now if we check it out now, we have this weird effect going on.

69
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:31,600
And that's because after we do this, we want to set the X value to whatever the current position is

70
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,060
and the Y values and the Y value to whatever, you know, y to is.

71
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,130
So now if I come over and draw.

72
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,370
Hmm.

73
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:51,160
So what's happening now is the line with is not as wide as the circle because I actually forgot down

74
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,430
here I set line with to the size, so line within the radius of a circle that, you know, there are

75
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,250
two different things.

76
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:05,360
So if I multiply this by two, it should end up working and being the same.

77
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,770
So now it's just a straight line, OK?

78
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,170
The width of the the radius of the circle or the size of the circle is the same now as the line width

79
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,890
of the line.

80
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,480
So they're both being drawn.

81
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,570
We don't have any of that skipping going on or anything like that.

82
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:20,920
All right.

83
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,880
So pretty cool.

84
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:26,610
Cool.

85
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:27,640
All right.

86
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:31,840
So in the next video, I want to have these controls work.

87
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:38,110
I want to be able to change the colour, change the line, the width of the size, I guess, and also

88
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,890
be able to clear it out with this button rather than having to reload.

89
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,270
So we'll do that next.
