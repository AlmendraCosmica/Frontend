1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,710
All right, so this is going to be a pretty simple project, but I think it's useful because there's

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,770
a lot of times when you need to notify a user of something, whether it's an error or just like a little

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:14,700
info block, and you'll often see these tost notifications.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:20,160
So something that will pop up in sometimes it's up in the corner here, sometimes it's down here.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,680
Or you could put it in the middle wherever you want, really.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,760
And you can see that it actually disappears after a few seconds because you don't want him to just stay

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,120
there.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,370
And we can have multiple notifications because maybe multiple things happened and then they all just

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,140
go away after a certain amount of time.

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,490
Now we're going to make it fun and just randomize the messages and the types.

11
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,130
You'll see that some of them have different colors.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,770
So like green is success, red is ever purple is info.

13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,360
So we're going to randomize those.

14
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,000
But I'm also going to show you how you can add a specific message and a specific type.

15
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,510
And you could use this in like form validation or something like that.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,200
All right.

17
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:01,740
So that's it.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,850
Let's go ahead and get into it.
