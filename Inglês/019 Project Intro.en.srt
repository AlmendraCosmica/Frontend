1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,510
All right, so in this project, we're going to build a scroll animation, which is is pretty simple.

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,960
We can most likely do this all in one video.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,460
However, it's very useful.

4
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,080
You might see these websites where you start scrolling in parts of the site, you know, images or sections

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,700
of the website start to come in.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,190
So I just created these content blocks.

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,020
And you can see there's three to begin with.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:28,640
But if I go and I start to scroll down, the next one comes in from the left, go down some more.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,810
Next one comes in from the right and it's going to alternate where it comes in from.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,700
So we're going to use CSFs transitions to have it come in smoothly.

11
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,290
We're going to use JavaScript to basically tell where the trigger point is for the next box to come

12
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,590
in.

13
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,550
And then we're going to add a specific class to show it.

14
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,590
And then if I go back up, it'll remove the class when it hits the trigger point and it'll all, you

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,760
know, slide back out.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,540
All right.

17
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,160
So I think it's really useful.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
You can use this in a lot of different uses and different websites.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,010
So that's it.

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:01,830
Let's get into it.
