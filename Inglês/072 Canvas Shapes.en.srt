1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,580
All right, so we're going to start on our JavaScript and we're using the canvas API, which is a way

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:13,650
to draw graphics or draw shapes on the canvas using JavaScript, and we're using the small five canvas

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,210
element.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:22,440
So basic example here, we can bring in our canvas and then we create a context using get context created

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,520
to add context.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,820
And then we can call certain we can set certain properties and methods like the film style set the green

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:32,220
Phil RACT will create a rectangle.

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,300
The first two are the positioning.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:42,270
So it's ten over from on the x axis of the canvas and then ten down on the y axis.

10
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,190
The width is 150.

11
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,840
The height of this is 100.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,620
All right.

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,240
So I'm just going to grab that.

14
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,570
So we're bringing in canvas.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:53,020
It does have an I.D. of canvas.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,390
So bring that in and then we create a context.

17
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:03,090
Now, I actually want to draw a circle, so I'm going to have a function called Draw Circle and we are

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,330
going to be using this function in the in the final version draw.

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,590
A circle is going to take in an X value in a Y value.

20
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:14,920
That's going to be the positioning on the canvas where we want to draw the circle.

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,500
Now, if we go, I think there's a link down here.

22
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,450
Yeah.

23
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,170
Drawing shapes and see paths.

24
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:35,490
And right here, so to draw a circle, we need to begin a path and then create an arc and the arc takes

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,000
in the positioning where you want to put it, the radius of the circle.

26
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,840
I think this is the start angle and the end angle is right here.

27
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,260
And then if you want it clockwise or counterclockwise.

28
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,370
So I'm actually going to.

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,220
Grab this.

30
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:04,270
So we're going to begin a path now, the values here, I don't want this is just this is 75 over 75

31
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,630
down.

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:12,610
I want this to be wherever X is that's passed in in Y and then the size I'm going to have in a variable

33
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,820
called size, and that's going to be a global variable.

34
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:18,970
So up here, I'll say let size and set that to 20.

35
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,340
OK, so that will get passed and then zero for the start and then the end will be yeah.

36
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,880
Math dot pi times two and then you don't need to pass anything in here.

37
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,780
So just doing that, if we take a look it doesn't do anything because we haven't filled the circle yet.

38
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:46,660
So what I'm going to do is set a color on the circle first through dot and then fill style.

39
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:52,330
And I'm going to set that to a variable called color, which I'm also going to set up here, because

40
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,540
we want we want this to be accessible outside of this function.

41
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:03,040
So the color initially all set to black and then let's fill the circle.

42
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,510
So take our context.

43
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:05,830
And there's a method called fill.

44
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,920
Now, if I save that, OK, we have to call the function.

45
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,800
Let's call, draw, circle.

46
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,150
And let's say we want to start at one hundred over and 200 down.

47
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:18,580
So save that.

48
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,190
And now it's going to plot a circle or draw a circle.

49
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:29,020
One hundred over on the x axis and 200 down on the Y and that's within the canvas, not the page.

50
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,510
All right.

51
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:38,650
Now, we also want to be able to draw lines, so let's say function, draw a line.

52
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,680
And this is going to take in the move to positions X and Y positions like where we want to move to and

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,240
also where we want to draw the line from in two.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,810
So what will pass in is X1 and Y one.

55
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,020
So that's going to be the move to X1 and why one.

56
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:04,310
And then the line to which draws the line will be X to and Y two.

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,250
All right.

58
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:17,410
So in here we need to again begin a path, so begin path and then let's do X dot move two and that's

59
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,830
going to be x1 y one.

60
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,780
So that's going to move to a specific position.

61
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,710
It's not going to plot anything or draw anything.

62
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,820
It's just going to move to it.

63
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:33,090
Then let's say it's line two and that's going to go to X two and Y two.

64
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:33,910
All right.

65
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:42,100
Now we need to want to apply a color so we do that with X dots and stroke style.

66
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,500
So stroke is like like a a border kind of.

67
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,820
So when we use a line, we're using a stroke.

68
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:53,680
So the strokes style is going to be the same color as the circle.

69
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:57,970
So the basically the global color, which is going to start off as black, we're going to be able to

70
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,220
ultimately choose our color here, but it's going to start as black and then the line width.

71
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:12,880
So let's say it's a line with and we're going to set that to a variable of size, which is this, you

72
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,230
know, twenty to start with.

73
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,730
And then finally to actually draw the line we need to call stroke.

74
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:21,070
So dot stroke.

75
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:29,680
And then let's go down here and let's say draw a line and we'll say, let's start 300 over on the x

76
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,250
axis.

77
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,160
Three hundred down on the Y axis.

78
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:38,080
So that's basically the move to which you can think of as having your pen off the paper.

79
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,580
You're moving to a certain spot.

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,330
The second two arguments we're passing in is the line two.

81
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,680
So that's what the pen down.

82
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,590
So we'll say we'll go from 300 to 500 by save that.

83
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,980
And I can see you have a line starts.

84
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,330
We move to three hundred three hundred and then we draw down from 300 to 500.

85
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:57,480
All right.

86
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,460
So and of course, you know, we can change if we want to do like a diagonal line.

87
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:09,370
We could change this to two hundred, something like that.

88
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,950
Now, we're not actually going to call these like this.

89
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:16,480
We want to call those when we have our most move event because it's going to be dynamic.

90
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,920
All right.

91
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:26,080
One of the thing that I want to do here is the X values and Y values.

92
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,130
I want those to be global as well, because we're going to be, you know, using those in multiple places

93
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:34,870
and reassigning them.

94
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,330
So I'm just going to initialize X.

95
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,160
We'll just say let X and we'll say let Y.

96
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,690
So they're undefined right now.

97
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,370
All right.

98
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,920
And I think that's good.

99
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,020
So in the next video, what we'll do is start to deal with our most events, like on the mouse move.

100
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,190
We want to be able to.

101
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,890
We want to create our circle and lines and we want to know if the button is pressed or not, too, for

102
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,650
moving because we only want to drive our moses' down.

103
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,260
So we'll get into that stuff in the next video.
