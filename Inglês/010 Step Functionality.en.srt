1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,880
So now we want to start on our JavaScript for this project.

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:06,840
So basically we want to be able to click on next and have it move to the next one.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,220
Click on previous.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,110
Haven't moved to the one before it.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,740
So let's start off by bringing in what we need.

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:24,870
Let's bring in progress and set that equal to document doget element by D and we have an idea of progress.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:34,950
OK, we also want to bring in the buttons so we have PreÅ¡ov set that to preserve and then we have next

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,760
set that to next.

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,780
And then we also want to bring in our circles.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:46,740
So for this, since there's more than one, make sure you put a dot here because it's the class circle.

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:54,090
And since it's more than one, we're going to use query selector all which will bring them all in as

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,400
a node list, which is similar to an array.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,420
So let's call this circles.

14
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:58,780
All right.

15
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,930
So that's all we want to bring in from the DOM.

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,380
So this here is going to be basically like an index.

17
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:09,600
We're going to call this current active, which is going to represent whichever one is active, which

18
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,220
will set to one by default.

19
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,360
And then let's have some event listeners.

20
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,650
So on actually, it's due next verse.

21
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,430
So we'll take the next button and let's add an event listener onto it.

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,870
We want to listen for a click.

23
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:32,400
And when it clicks, we're going to run a function and we want to take that whatever the current active

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,710
is at the time and increment it by one.

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,830
So plus plus will you know if it's set to one, it'll set it to two and so on.

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,860
And in fact, we'll just go ahead and console log current active.

27
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,690
And if we go over here and open up the console, I click next goes to two, three, four or five and

28
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,320
so on.

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,060
So let's get rid of that.

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,730
We do want to keep it within its boundaries.

31
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:07,650
So let's make sure that if it gets to the end, it doesn't go past four.

32
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,540
So we'll do an if statement here.

33
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:16,710
And let's say if the current active is greater than and then we can take circles which we brought in

34
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,940
and it's a node list so we can treat it like an array.

35
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,950
So it has a length property.

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,400
So we'll say if it's greater than the length length, meaning the amount of circles in this case for

37
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,960
then let's set the current active let's set that to whatever the length is, which will be, you know,

38
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,740
the last one.

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,350
So we're going to say circles dot length.

40
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:47,420
OK, now if we go and we click next actually adds to the console log again.

41
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,120
So current, active and the next so two, three, four and noticed is staying at four, it's not going

42
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,220
to five, so that's what we want.

43
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:07,140
And then for now, we're going to have obviously we need to, you know, show this in the dorm.

44
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,450
But before we do that, I just want to create the previous.

45
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,730
So I'm going to copy that.

46
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:20,160
And let's say we've got out event listener and we want to take the current active and we want to decrement

47
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,940
that by one.

48
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,460
So we'll do minus minus.

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:32,580
And then for the check here, we're going to say if the current active is less than one, then we know

50
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,720
we're at the very beginning.

51
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,310
So we just want to set current active to one, OK, because we don't want it to go under into, you

52
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,090
know, zero negative and so on.

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,740
So we have those two event listeners.

54
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,350
Now, after we do that, we're going to call a function called update.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
So we're going to call update there.

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,040
We're also going to call it right here.

57
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,560
So basically we're going to update the dorm.

58
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,280
So down here, let's create a function called update.

59
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:12,710
And first thing we'll do here is take our circles, which is a node list, and we can loop through those

60
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,050
with a for each and the four each takes in a function.

61
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:24,800
I'm going to use an arrow function and we want to say for each circle and then I'm also going to get

62
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,870
the index, OK?

63
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:35,810
So for each circle, I'm going to check to see if the index of that particular circle is less than the

64
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,520
current active.

65
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,390
If that's so, then I'm going to add the active class onto it.

66
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,190
So I'll take that particular circle.

67
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:50,580
I keep misspelling circle and say classless dot and then we can add in the class of active.

68
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:58,960
OK, else then we want to take a circle and remove the class.

69
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,770
So classless dot remove

70
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,070
active.

71
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,980
OK, so I'll save that.

72
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:13,760
And now if I click this you'll see that this second circle is now highlighted by click next again.

73
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,550
Highlighted next again and so on.

74
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:18,820
All right.

75
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,320
And I realize we can't do the previous yet, but we'll get to that.

76
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:32,330
So after this for each year, let's get all of the active circles, because, you know, once we click

77
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:38,210
this active is on now on all of these circles, I can show you here so you can see activities on all

78
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:38,630
of them.

79
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:47,000
So I'm going to say const actives and set that to document dot, query selector all.

80
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,690
And we want all the class of active.

81
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,140
All right.

82
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,430
Now we want to handle the the progress bar because we don't want just the circles lighting up.

83
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,990
We want these lines to light blue as well.

84
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,880
So the way we can do this, let me just first of all, console log.

85
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:10,130
So if I say actives, let's do actives length.

86
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:20,880
And let's do circles dot length and go to our console here and click so we get to four.

87
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,270
So two is the number of actives and the circles is always going to be four because that's all of the

88
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,620
circles I click again.

89
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,830
We get three, four, four, four.

90
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:40,710
So I want to get a percentage for our progress, length or not length width, because if we look in

91
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,950
our progress class, it's a width of zero percent.

92
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,120
We want to change that.

93
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,970
When we go ahead and click, we want that to change so that the line goes to the next one, the next

94
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,800
one and so on.

95
00:06:52,620 --> 00:07:01,890
So if we take the actives length, actually, let's just cancel log this, take the active length divide

96
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:08,080
that by Circle's length we get point five point seventy five and then one.

97
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,560
Now our goal is to get these to be percentages for the success with property.

98
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:23,910
So let's wrap this right here, this whole thing in parentheses, and then let's multiply that by one

99
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:31,890
hundred and then that's going to give us fifty, 75, 100, which isn't correct, because 50 is going

100
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,360
to bring it to here and then it'll go to 75.

101
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,000
Actually we can just we can try this so you can see.

102
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:46,530
So instead of console logging this, let's get rid of the wrapped parentheses here and we'll keep this

103
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,030
wrapped and set the progress dot style.

104
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,170
And we want the with property, which is initially zero percent.

105
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,710
And let's set it to that and see what happens if I click next.

106
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,400
All right.

107
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,450
So we're not seeing the line because what we're doing here is setting the width to 100.

108
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,070
But there's no unit.

109
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,480
It has to be 100 percent.

110
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,250
So I'm just going to concatenate on with a plus sign a percent.

111
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,950
Now, let's click next and you can see the blue line fills up, although it's not going to the right

112
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:25,320
place, it's going past the two because remember, it was 50, 75, 100, which we don't want.

113
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:31,650
We want to change it to be like, you know, thirty three percent, 66 percent.

114
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:39,270
So we can fix that by just taking the circles, lengthen the actives length and subtracting one from

115
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:39,720
those.

116
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,220
Which will give us a lower percentage, so let's do that and now if I click next.

117
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,250
Wait a minute, that's not right.

118
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,630
We have to wrap this and we have to wrap this.

119
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:56,870
There we go.

120
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,790
So now it goes to two.

121
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:04,520
So it's around the width is around three percent and then it goes to three, which is around 66.

122
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,240
And then next.

123
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,450
And it goes to four.

124
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,030
All right.

125
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,680
Now, obviously, we can't go back with the previous.

126
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,780
So let's continue on here.

127
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:21,700
And I want to first check we're just going to do an if statement here and check the current active.

128
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:30,950
So if the current active is equal to one, so if it's in its first place, we want previous to be disabled

129
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,100
so we can take the previous spot and then we can simply set disabled and we can set that to true.

130
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:44,530
It's initially set to true, but we're going to make it we're going to take that off once we click next.

131
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,820
But if we go back, we want to go back to true.

132
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:54,500
So we want to set that and then let's do an else if and for this else if we're going to say if the current

133
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,500
basically want to see if it's at the end.

134
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:03,740
So if it equals the total length of circles, circles, length, then we know it's at the end.

135
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,720
So then we'll disable the next button.

136
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,140
So we'll take next and set disabled and set that to true else.

137
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,150
Then we want to we don't want either of them to be disabled.

138
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:23,140
So we'll take previous DOT disabled and set that to false.

139
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,430
And we also want to do the same with next.

140
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,930
This means that we're in the middle, so we'll save that.

141
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:30,830
I'll click next.

142
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:36,730
And now previous is available to us if I click next again and then next again.

143
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:43,910
Now I can't click next because we're at the end by click previous goes back back and then goes disabled.

144
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,590
OK, so that's it.

145
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:52,040
And I know obviously this by itself isn't much use to you, but you can at least see how the logic works

146
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,480
as far as the progress bar.

147
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:01,430
And you could use this in any kind of steps, really a shopping cart, whatever it might be, a form,

148
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,360
