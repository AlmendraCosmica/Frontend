1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:06,420
OK, so now that we were able to fill and empty these small cups down here, we want to work on the

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,060
big ones.

3
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,280
So we're going to actually call the function we're going to create in two places.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,070
One is going to be right when the the application loads.

5
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,150
So let's call update big cup.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,720
And then we also want to call it when we click on one of these.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,720
So at the end of highlight cups.

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,800
So right under the loop here, let's say update big cup and let's go down here and let's create function

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,510
update big cup.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,360
So the first thing I want to do is get the amount, the number of full glasses.

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,900
So that's pretty easy.

12
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:48,540
We can just create a variable called full glasses or let's call it four cups, not four glasses.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,720
So full cups is going to be document dots.

14
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:00,840
So document dot, query selector all because we want to select all the full cups.

15
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:08,460
So in here, let's pass in the rest of the class of cups small and also have the class of fall in the

16
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:08,970
inquiry.

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,770
Select our inquiry, select are all we can pass in next selector.

18
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,240
So this is just going to get all the full ones and we want to get the length, so let's say at length.

19
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:24,720
And then just to show you that we can console log the full cups.

20
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,240
And we'll go down here and we see zero because it calls it right away, but then I'm going to click

21
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,800
on this one here we see that there's two, three, four and so on.

22
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,570
So we have the full cops.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,920
Let's also get the total cops.

24
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:45,850
So consed total cops, which is just going to be all the small cops.

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:52,960
So Langguth, no small cops we brought in up here, which gives us a no list which we can call lengthen

26
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:59,530
so we can see the total cops here, which is always going to be eight right now.

27
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:07,000
I want to hide the percentage which we don't have an actual percentage in there right now anyways.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,610
But let's just say we did like 20 percent.

29
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,720
We want that to hide if if it's empty.

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,020
So if there's no full cops.

31
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:18,250
So let's say if.

32
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,680
If full cops is equal to zero, that means that it should be empty.

33
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:33,510
So we want the percentage, we want the style and I'm going to set the visibility equal to hidden.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,210
And let's also set the height.

35
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:46,660
So percentage of percentage style height.

36
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,840
I'm going to set that to zero.

37
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:57,720
OK, now you can see that kind of flashes for a second there, but it is actually setting it to hidden

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,270
and setting it the height zero.

39
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,180
So I'm just going to get rid of that hardcoded 20 percent there.

40
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,710
Now let's have an L.

41
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,440
So basically, if if it has something in it, then we want that percentage.

42
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,600
We want it to show.

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,320
So let's set this style dot visibility.

44
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:28,500
We want to set that now to visible and let's set percentage dot style.

45
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:35,880
And we want to set the height, style, height and the height we're going to actually get by doing let's

46
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:43,740
put some back ticks in here, but we can get the height by taking the full glass are full cups and divide

47
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:50,520
it by the total cups and then multiply it by the height of this large cup here, which if you remember

48
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,190
is three hundred and thirty pixels.

49
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:58,590
So whatever, whatever the height is, that's what we want to multiply it by and then pass in here.

50
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,520
Just pixels.

51
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,960
It's going to save that.

52
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,120
Close this up.

53
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,650
If I hit this first one here it's going to fill it up to their, their.

54
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,540
OK, now we want the text to say the percentage as well, right now we're only filling the height,

55
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:27,400
so let's set the percentage in our text and we're going to set that to a set of tactics.

56
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:35,200
And and here once again, we're going to get the full cups and we want to divide that by the total cups.

57
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:42,630
And let's multiply that by 100 because we want to get like, you know, 25 percent whatever.

58
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,200
So I'll save that.

59
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,840
If I click this first one, we get twelve point five.

60
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,400
Actually, let's just add a percentage sign right here.

61
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,900
So we get twelve point five percent, 25 percent, 37.

62
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,520
That's half.

63
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,270
That's fifty sixty two seventy five.

64
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,560
Eighty seven point five.

65
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,190
One hundred.

66
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,790
Now we still have this up here.

67
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,280
This remained, which we don't want to show if this is fall.

68
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,340
So underneath this if statement here, let's create another one and we're going to deal with the remain

69
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:12,700
now.

70
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:21,280
So we want to check to see if full cups is equal to the total cups, meaning it's fall.

71
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:29,920
So if it's full, we're going to take remained and we're going to set the style dot visibility to hidden

72
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,180
because we don't want to show that.

73
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,440
And then let's also set the height to zero.

74
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,390
So remained dot style, dot height.

75
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,840
We're going to set that to zero.

76
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,480
So save and we're going to see this remained until it's completely full, then it goes away.

77
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,450
Even if it's here we can see it now.

78
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,790
It's we we don't see the remain text anymore because we've removed it from the DOM.

79
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:59,490
We've set the visibility to hidden and we've never set it back or the height.

80
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,630
So here we want to have an LS.

81
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:10,210
Then we'll set remained dot style dot visibility and we want to set that back to visible if it's not

82
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:10,570
full.

83
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:10,900
Right.

84
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,340
So set that to visible.

85
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,540
And we also want to set the text of remained.

86
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:24,730
So if I just save this right now, fill it up and disappears, if it's not totally full we do see remain

87
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,110
but we don't see the leaders.

88
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:29,590
Remember up here we have a span with the idea of leaders.

89
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:32,290
So we want to show the leaders that are remaining.

90
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:38,650
So to do that, let's say remained and we want to set I'm sorry, not remain.

91
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,880
We want to set leaders.

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,420
We brought that in up at the beginning.

93
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,940
At the beginning at the top.

94
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:48,760
Want to set the entire text of that and let's put some back ticks here.

95
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,430
And what I'm going to do is take two fifty, because that's the number down here of milliliters.

96
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,490
And we want to divide that, not divide.

97
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:08,440
Multiply that by the full cups and then we want to divide that by a thousand because we wanted to say,

98
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,130
you know, zero point two five or zero point five, whatever.

99
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:17,800
And then I'm going to just let's just see what this does, actually.

100
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,360
So I click on that.

101
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,460
It says zero point two five remain.

102
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,240
That's not true.

103
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,740
It's actually zero point two five full of four of two leaders.

104
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:33,070
If I click on this one here, it says one remained click here, one point two, five remain, which

105
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,240
is not correct.

106
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,140
Right.

107
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,410
If I click on this one, one point seventy five remain is not correct.

108
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,340
It should be zero point two five remained on the spot.

109
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:51,730
So what we'll do is let's wrap this in parentheses, what we just put here and let's go to the beginning

110
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:57,100
here and say two, which is the total number of leaders and minus that from it.

111
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,040
Now, if I click on the first one, we have one seven five remained by click on this one here we only

112
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,110
have point to five remained.

113
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:10,930
OK, so, I mean, obviously, if I click here, it's 100 percent we have zero remained.

114
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,640
So.

115
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,850
So that should do it good.

116
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,610
Actually, I want to put an L there for leaders, so right after the curly brace, we'll just put an

117
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,020
L.

118
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,810
So two leaders remained here, one point five, seven remained.

119
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:35,180
And it's twelve point five percent full, 25 percent full, one point five leader remaining.

120
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:35,470
All right.

121
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,660
So seems to be working.

122
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:37,360
So that's it.

123
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,310
Let's go ahead and move on to the next project.
