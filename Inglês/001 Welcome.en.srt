Hey, guys, welcome to the 50 projects, 50 days course, so this course is really meant for beginners

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,980
or intermediate level Web developers that want a cool, unique project to do every day.

3
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,250
And these are just HTML in JavaScript.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,920
There's no front end frameworks used or anything like that.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:23,010
And they're really meant to sharpen your skills, your JavaScript skills and just working with the doorman

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:23,520
general.

7
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,380
So I actually created this course with a friend of mine, Floren Pop.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,520
He might know him from Twitter or Twitter or YouTube, and he actually created all these projects.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,620
So I definitely want to give him credit for that.

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,110
And as far as what you should know, before taking this course, I would say just the very basics of

11
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,470
those three technologies, HTML, access, JavaScript.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:48,090
I mean, I'm not going to explain what a variable is or how to import a stylesheet or anything like

13
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:48,390
that.

14
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,190
So you should know the very basics.

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,960
But just about anyone can take this course and there's 50 different projects.

16
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,550
We might add more later.

17
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:58,650
We might switch up some later.

18
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,010
But like I said, they're really meant to sharpen your skills and just give you something fun to create.

19
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,470
So if that sounds good, then let's go ahead and jump in and get started.
