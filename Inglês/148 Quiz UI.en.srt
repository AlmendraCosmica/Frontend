1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,550
All right, so let's start on the table for our quiz title, say quiz app.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:14,930
And essentially, what we're going to do is just have a placeholder, kind of a placeholder for a question,

3
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,140
it'll be an H2, will give it an ID and then we'll have a bunch of radio inputs for the answer.

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,910
And those will also be placeholders.

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,340
And then later on, when we get to the JavaScript, we will replace the placeholders with the actual

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,430
questions and answers and we'll use that as basically as a template for each one.

7
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,320
And then we can have as many question answers as we want.

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:44,520
So let's start off by just creating a quiz container and I'm going to give us an idea of CUI'S.

9
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,500
And then we'll have a class of quiz heter.

10
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:58,800
And inside here, we'll have our question, which is going to be an H2 with an idea of question, and

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,100
I'm just going to, like I said, put a placeholder here.

12
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:07,620
We'll just say question text and then under that will have a UFO with some list items in each list item

13
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:15,510
will have a radio input radius, radio input with a name of answer.

14
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,990
And then the ID is going to be a for this one.

15
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:27,420
And let's see, we also want to do a class answer and that should be good.

16
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,550
Then underneath it, we're going to have a label for is going to match the ID of the input, which is

17
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:43,230
a and let's also give this an I.D. of a underscore text because we're going to insert the question in

18
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,470
here.

19
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,110
We'll just say question for now.

20
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,950
So basically, we just want to copy this and each question will have four answers.

21
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,200
So that's one, two, three, four.

22
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,140
And then we just want to change some of this stuff.

23
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:04,660
So the second one, so we want the name to be answer for all of them, but the idea is going to change.

24
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:11,790
So that's going to be B and the four attribute on the label as well is going to be B and then the ID

25
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,440
here is going to be BTX.

26
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:23,000
And then we want to do the same here, so let's go here, here and here and let's change that to see.

27
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:33,330
And then we'll go here, here and here, and it's going to be OK, and then we want submit button that's

28
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,150
going to go outside of the header.

29
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,380
So right here and let's add a button.

30
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,620
We're going to give this an idea of submit and we'll say submit.

31
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,680
All right, so it doesn't look very good right now, but we're going to go ahead and add the success,

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,830
which isn't too bad.

33
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,940
So let's jump in to our stylesheet and we're going to use the Poppins font.

34
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:06,930
So I'm going to say success to questionmark family.

35
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,400
And let's set this.

36
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:24,110
To Poppins and then let's do a wait so t say at and then 200 semicolon 400.

37
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:30,290
I'm going to change the body font to that Poppins.

38
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,460
All right, so we want we also want a background color on the body, so let's set that background.

39
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:49,050
Color is going to be hexadecimal value B eight, C, six DB.

40
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:56,000
OK, and then let's add actually, that will be the background color.

41
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,510
We're going to use a gradient, a linear gradient for browser's and support that.

42
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:11,040
So let's use background image and set linear gradient and we'll do three 15 degrees and the colors for

43
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,580
this, the first one, let's do hexadecimal.

44
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,040
Actually it's going to be the same color here.

45
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:29,880
So we want to do that at zero percent and then comma in the next color will be EF five, EF seven F

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,310
A to 100 percent.

47
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,160
So give it just a little bit of a gradient look, and then we have our flex box, we can get rid of

48
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,560
Flex Direction column.

49
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:49,490
And let's see a line item that's good press should be OK.

50
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,770
So now the quiz container which wraps around everything.

51
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,150
So for that, I'm going to set the background color to white.

52
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:18,470
And let's give this a broader radius of 10 pixels and let's do a box shadow, so four box Shadowville

53
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:26,660
do zero zero for the offsets, 10 pixels, two pixels, and then our GBA and the car will be one hundred,

54
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,760
one hundred, one hundred.

55
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,670
And then for the alpha value will be zero point one.

56
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:40,430
OK, let's set a with here as well of six hundred pixels.

57
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:50,120
And then I'm going to set an overflow of hidden so nothing goes out of the container and then for the

58
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,180
for the header, remember, this whole part is the quiz header and then you have the button below it.

59
00:05:55,550 --> 00:06:05,020
So let's say for the quiz had class, I want some padding and we'll just do forum, which is going to

60
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:09,920
be four times whatever the root HTML elements, font sizes.

61
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:19,250
And then for the H2, which is the question or style that let's do padding will do one room and let's

62
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:25,300
do text a line to the center and get rid of any margin.

63
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,560
And then for the U.S., all we don't want any bullet points.

64
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,970
So let's set list style type to none and let's set padding to zero.

65
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:49,370
Now for the list items say U.S. ally are U.S. ally, and I'm going to set the font size to be a little

66
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:49,700
bigger.

67
00:06:49,730 --> 00:07:01,130
Let's do one point to get one point to them and then we'll set the margin on that to be one on the top

68
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,620
and bottom zero on the left and right and for the label.

69
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:09,170
So you'll ally label.

70
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:14,640
I just want to make the cursor into a pointer.

71
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,320
All right.

72
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,780
So if we hover over these, we get our, you know, our pointer.

73
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,270
So last thing we want to style is the button.

74
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,900
So describe button.

75
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,680
Let's set a background color.

76
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:41,850
And that's going to be eight E four for a D and then let's take away any border source that border to

77
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,360
none.

78
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,380
Let's also make the color of the text white.

79
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:57,210
And we want to display this as a bloc level elements, and I want it to go all the way across, set

80
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:03,420
the width to 100 percent, and let's make the cursor into a pointer.

81
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,430
Oops.

82
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,690
And for the font size, I'm going to make that one point, one RAM unit.

83
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:23,920
And then let's see for the font family we just want to inherit, so we use that Poppins font and then

84
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,410
the padding for the button is going to be one point three ram.

85
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:36,630
OK, so looks pretty good now for the hover save button.

86
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,470
And when it's in its hover state, I want to change the background color and I'm going to change it

87
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:50,570
to 73 to Denine one on hover.

88
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:57,650
OK, so it's just a little darker and then I want you to see this outline what's in its focus state.

89
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:58,520
Want to get rid of that.

90
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,400
So it's a button in its focus state.

91
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,640
Let's set the outline to none.

92
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:17,020
And I'm also going to set the background color to five E3 and three seven.

93
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,820
Oh, all right.

94
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,140
So the success is done, we have basically just a template here that we're going to use and then the

95
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,920
next video will have our questions in a JavaScript array and we want to basically replace it.

96
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,130
We want to be able to, you know, have a correct answer for each question and check that we want to

97
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,190
be able to submit and load the next question.

98
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,610
So we'll get into that next.
