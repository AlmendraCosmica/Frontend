1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:06,690
So like I said, in this project, we're going to get into working with the API, making an HTTP request

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,720
to a third party API that gives us dad jokes.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:15,390
But before we get into any of that, I just want to create the the HTML access, which isn't going to

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:15,950
be too much.

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,770
So we can probably get all that done in this video.

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,210
So let's go ahead and change the title here to Dad jokes.

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:27,950
And there's not going to be much here.

8
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:41,530
We're going to have a container that wraps in H3 and in this H3 will say, don't laugh challenge and

9
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:48,680
let's have a div here with an idea of joke and then I'm going to give it a class of joke for styling.

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,510
So basically, this is where the joke is going to go.

11
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,860
I'll just put a you know what?

12
00:00:53,890 --> 00:01:02,050
We'll just do this joke goes here and that's going to be replaced once, you know, once we make the

13
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:07,990
request and we're able to put the joke into the DOM and then we want a button to get another joke.

14
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:18,790
So let's create a button here and let's give this an idea of joke BTN and then we'll give this a class

15
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:25,480
of BTN for styling and say, get another joke.

16
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,660
OK, so save that doesn't look too good.

17
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,180
So we're going to jump into our stylesheet here.

18
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,110
And let's see, let's give the body of background color.

19
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:44,600
So background color is going to be six eight six d e zero.

20
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,020
That's going to be our background is a blue.

21
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,730
And let's see, we want to leave all this stuff center center.

22
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,090
Good.

23
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:00,070
And then our container that wraps around everything to set that background color.

24
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:09,600
To white, white, OK, we'll go ahead and save that, some of the things we want to add to this container

25
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:12,720
is a border radius so we can give it some rounded corners.

26
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,980
Let's do 10 pixels and I'm going to add box shadow.

27
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,640
I'm going to add two shadows, which I'm actually just going to paste in here.

28
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,950
Ah, yeah.

29
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,980
Two shadows.

30
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,680
We have the first one here.

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:35,800
So zero 10 pixel for the offsets, 20 pixel blur color and this one here.

32
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,600
So if we save that, you can see we have rounded corners and we have a bit of a shadow.

33
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,260
Now we need some padding to take all the content away from the edges there.

34
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:54,230
So let's do 50 on the top and bottom 20 on the left and right, and then let's align everything text

35
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:04,260
aligned to the center and let's set a max with two one hundred percent and I'm going to set the width

36
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,140
to 800 pixels.

37
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,200
And let's actually add a little bit of padding on the body just so we have some space on the side on

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,370
these small screens.

39
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,300
So I'll say padding 20 pixels.

40
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:19,800
All right.

41
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,090
Now for the content in the container, let's do the H3.

42
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,170
So H3, I'm going to set the margin to zero.

43
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:38,310
And I'm also going to give it an opacity of zero point five just to kind of give it that transparent

44
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:38,640
look.

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:44,970
And I want to set letter spacing to two pixels.

46
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,160
OK, now for the joke of the class of joke.

47
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:52,020
Watch right now.

48
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,940
Just says JoCo joke goes here, but this will be the joke that we fetch from the API.

49
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:06,180
So I'm going to set this font size to be 30 pixels and let's set the letter spacing.

50
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:17,730
I'm going to set that to one pixel and I'm going to set the line height to 40 pixels and margin is going

51
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,100
to be 50 on the top and bottom.

52
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,820
And we'll say auto on the left and right.

53
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:30,030
So gives us plenty of room and give it a max width of six hundred pixels.

54
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,320
OK, so that's the joke.

55
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,650
Now the last thing we have is the button.

56
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:43,920
So that has a class of BTN and I'm going to give that a background color, same background color, and

57
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:51,660
that's going to be hexadecimal number which is going to be nine f six eight eight zero.

58
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:56,160
So purple color and border will be zero.

59
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,350
And let's set the border radius on the button to 10 pixels.

60
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,920
OK, let's make the color whites shall move that up there.

61
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:13,470
And let's give this a box shadow as well, which I'm going to just copy.

62
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,150
OK, there we go now we obviously need some padding there and change the font size, so it's that for

63
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,100
the padding will do 14 top and bottom, 40 left and right.

64
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:35,060
And let's up the font size, say, 16 pixels.

65
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,030
OK, that looks pretty good.

66
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,640
Let's make sure the cursor is a pointer and that should do it.

67
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,140
So now we have our button.

68
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,610
We want to get rid of that outline.

69
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:56,480
So let's say BTN when it's in its focus state, we want the outline to be zero so we don't have that

70
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,440
ugly outline.

71
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,510
And when it's active, when we click it, we'll just make it scaled down a little bit.

72
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:10,430
So let's say class button when it's active, meaning when we click and hold, we want to add a transform

73
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:17,870
effect and we're going to use scale and let's scale it from one to point nine eight.

74
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,330
So it'll just go down a little bit like that.

75
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,810
OK, so that's good enough for the styling.

76
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,350
In the next video, we're going to get into the Fetch API.

77
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,360
I'm going to talk a little bit about how that works.

78
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,390
I know a lot of you guys already know this, but just for those that don't, it's important to understand

79
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:40,430
at least the very basics about how Fetch works and how HTTP requests work.
