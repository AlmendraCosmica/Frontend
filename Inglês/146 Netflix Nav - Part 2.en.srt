1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,190
All right, so now we're going to finish most of the cost and then add the JavaScript for the button

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:11,550
functionality, and then I want to add some other effects later so we can delay because we have three

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,770
boxes, the red, white and black.

4
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,200
And I want them to come out like one after another.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,480
So we will add some transition delays.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,200
But for now, let's finish the basic styling.

7
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:25,420
So we're going to add now black ember, this black, red and white.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:32,300
So for black, let's set the background color to be and let's do three, four for black.

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,020
I'm sorry for red three one.

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,680
So just really low numbers.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,060
It's not quite black, but it's dark.

12
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:42,270
We can't see it yet because we want to add a width.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:51,290
Let's do 60 percent and then I want to add a max width of 480.

14
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,140
So it shouldn't come out past 480 no matter what.

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,250
And then a Menwith.

16
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,550
So the Menwith will do three 20.

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,440
All right.

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,100
And then.

19
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,300
Yeah, that should do it for now.

20
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:14,730
So then the red let's do Naved Dash Red and we're going to set our background color for that to be and

21
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,160
then pass in for red two to nine.

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,670
So really high number and then nine and 20.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,870
OK, now we can't see that just yet.

24
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,970
So let's.

25
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,950
Let's add a width of 95 percent.

26
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:41,140
OK, so now you can see the red comes out, but you can still see the black behind it on the side here,

27
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,450
which is what we want.

28
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,060
And then for the white part, so it's a Naved Dash White.

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:58,330
For that, the background color is going to be pure white, so I'll just use hexadecimal and we want

30
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:07,300
it to come out, so let's say with 95 percent and now we have what looks like a black and red stripe

31
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,610
here.

32
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,650
So when it comes out and goes in, it's going to do it at different rates.

33
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,760
We're going to add a delay.

34
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,930
But like I said, I just want to get the basic styling down first.

35
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,270
So I'm also going to add padding here.

36
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,070
Since this is wrapping, the content will do 40 pixels padding, move everything in.

37
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:30,670
Let's position this relative because we are going to want to position the close button absolute within

38
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:30,850
it.

39
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,360
And yeah, that's it for now.

40
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:43,390
And then for the close button, say close dash BTN, we're going to position that absolute.

41
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:53,800
And where I want to put this within the nav white container is 40 pixels from the top and 30 pixels

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,800
from the right.

43
00:02:55,210 --> 00:03:01,660
So now you can see that we're also going to make it a little lighter by adding an opacity value of zero

44
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,880
point three, which will feed it out a bit.

45
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,150
Now, let's see.

46
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,880
This is what we have left is the list.

47
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:18,490
So let's say for the class of list, which is the the initial you will and I want to get rid of any

48
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,240
bullet points.

49
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,150
So list, style type, we're going to set that to none.

50
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:30,590
And the padding, I'm going to get rid of the default padding zero and then the list items.

51
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,870
So list L, I want to spread them out.

52
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,670
So margin 20 pixels on the top and bottom that'll spread them out.

53
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:49,690
Then we're going to do the links so the ally tags and let's set the color of that, the color I'm going

54
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:55,540
to set to be the same black that we have for the background of one of the maps.

55
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,960
And then let's make the font size.

56
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:02,980
Font size is going to be fourteen pixels.

57
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,770
I've got my semicolon here, OK, and then we want to get rid of the text underline.

58
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:15,280
So text decoration is going to be fun and let's also make it uppercase.

59
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,840
So text transform.

60
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,060
I'm going to set that to uppercase.

61
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,350
All right.

62
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,310
So looks pretty good.

63
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,410
Now we do have a little nested within the list and you can see it has the bullet points here.

64
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:36,340
So let's say list and then the you'll within the list will set the list style type to none.

65
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,680
And for padding left, it's a padding left.

66
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,220
We're going to set that to twenty pixels because we do want it to stick out a bit.

67
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:46,390
All right.

68
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:51,460
So I think that looks pretty good and that's most of the CSFs.

69
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,440
Now, I want to jump into the JavaScript here, and there's basically three things you want to grab

70
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,220
the open button, the closed button and the nav, although we have multiple classes of NAV one on each

71
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,360
of these colors.

72
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:13,090
So let's first bring in, let's say, open, underscore, beaten, and we're going to use document dot,

73
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,470
query selector.

74
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,180
And that has a class of open dash BTN.

75
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:26,650
So it's just a convention that Floren and I like to use is dashes or hyphens and access.

76
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,000
And then if you're going to create a variable here, you can't use a hyphen.

77
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,500
So you use an underscore or sometimes you'll see, you know, the camel case.

78
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,480
But in this case, we're just going to do underscore and then we're going to get the close button as

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:40,990
well.

80
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,470
And you could use an underscore in your classes.

81
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,240
I just don't like doing that.

82
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,560
So close button now for the NAV.

83
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,060
We have multiple of those.

84
00:05:52,060 --> 00:06:00,790
So what that means is we have to use query selector all and we want to grab the class of NAV and that

85
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:04,150
will give us a node list that we can basically loop through.

86
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,140
So let's take the open button and let's add an event listener.

87
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,500
Right.

88
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:11,230
So out of that listener, we want to listen for click event.

89
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:15,010
When that happens will fire off a function.

90
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:21,340
And we don't have to use curly races here, but I'm going to just to make it neater.

91
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,510
So we'll take our NAVs and we're going to loop through.

92
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,090
So for each because there's multiple NAVs and we'll save for each nav element.

93
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:38,440
We want to take that nav element and we want to add the visible class.

94
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:47,140
So l dot class list dot add and we want to add the class visible.

95
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:48,640
All right.

96
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,810
Because we're adding it on.

97
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,330
Multiple now, that's why we have to loop through the node list here now, close button is going to

98
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,190
be pretty much the same thing, except we're removing the class.

99
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:04,270
So I'm going to put that in here and grab the close button at a click event.

100
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:10,620
And then for each nav, we want to then remove the class visible.

101
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,170
All right.

102
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:17,140
So I'll save that and I'm going to go ahead and delete these visible classes that I just, you know,

103
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,790
hardcoded in here.

104
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,260
So I'll get rid of those.

105
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,190
And it should now be off the screen.

106
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,820
If I click, it's going to go ahead and open.

107
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,890
If I click, the exit closes.

108
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,650
Now, it doesn't have the effect that I want.

109
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,390
I want it to be I want the three parts to come out kind of separately to give it a cool little effect.

110
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:45,760
So in our stylesheet here, we're going to add on to let's see, so on the nav black, basically, we're

111
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,840
going to just add transition delays on certain colors.

112
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,970
So now black right here.

113
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:57,910
Let's say we want to add a transition delay, which means that it'll just wait however long we we put

114
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,070
here before it actually fires off.

115
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,680
So I'm going to delay it by point.

116
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:05,290
Four seconds for the black.

117
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,100
OK, so now we close.

118
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,570
You can see the black takes a little longer.

119
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:20,260
Now we also want to add a delay or I should say remove the delay on the visible for black.

120
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:28,090
So what we'll do is say now dash black and if it has the class of visible, then we want the transition

121
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,120
delay to be zero seconds.

122
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:33,710
All right.

123
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:40,100
So it comes right out and then it kind of lags when it goes back in.

124
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,810
So on the red we have now red right here, let's add a transition delay, which is going to be a little

125
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,100
faster than the black because it's it doesn't stick out as much.

126
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:59,300
So let's do instead of what we do for for the Black Point, for let's do point two seconds for that.

127
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:06,430
And now you can see it has that effect where, you know, the red goes in and then the black goes in.

128
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:09,890
Now, when it's visible on that red

129
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:20,160
navarrette visible, basically when we open it, we want to add a transition delay of point two seconds.

130
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:26,850
So now when I open, you can see that the red has a little delay.

131
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,280
Now we want to do the same for the white because you can see when it opens, the red and the white come

132
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,900
in at the same exact time.

133
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,760
I don't want that.

134
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,980
I want the white to fan in as well.

135
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:39,550
So let's go to now of white.

136
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:48,080
And when it's not visible, we're going to set the transition delay to zero seconds.

137
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,600
But on the visible.

138
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,880
So now dash white.

139
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:55,390
And when when I say visible, that is basically when it opens.

140
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,760
So when the visible let's do a transition delay of point four seconds.

141
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:08,540
OK, so now you can see black, red, white when it goes in white, red, black.

142
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,930
So it's just the timing of the transition delay.

143
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,760
All right, and that that's pretty much it.

144
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:18,550
So it's just a cool little effect.

145
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:22,620
It's of course, it's responsive, you know, small screens.

146
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,270
This will work fine.

147
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,040
But yeah.

148
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,110
So that's going to be it for this project.

149
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,250
Guys hopefully liked it.

150
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,900
