1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,750
All right, let's get started with our feedback design or feedback UI design, and I just have my project

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,640
starter open here.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,790
I do have a link to font.

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:15,480
Awesome, because on the you know, once we submit the feedback, there's an icon on that screen there.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,730
So we're going to use that and we're just going to change the title here to let's say, let us know

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:34,170
your feedback and we're going to get rid of this H1 here and let's create a container here.

7
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:41,150
I'm going to give us an idea of panel and also class of panel Dasch container.

8
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:54,170
And in here, we're going to have a strong tag and let's say, how satisfied are you with our.

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,100
And then I just want to put a line break here to make sure that the rest of this goes on to a new line

10
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,930
and then say customer support performance.

11
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:13,050
And underneath that strong, we're going to have a ratings container, so it's a ratings Dasch container

12
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,000
and this is going to contain the three boxes with the, you know, those the faces.

13
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,660
So each one will have a class of rating.

14
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,230
So it's two rating and inside here will have an image.

15
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,800
And these images are actually from flat icon dot com.

16
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,710
So I'm just going to pieces and these are FGs.

17
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:40,710
I'm going to paste in that first one there and underneath the image still within the rating div will

18
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,020
have a small tag with the actual rating, so this would be unhappy.

19
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,630
So if I save that, that's what we're going to see.

20
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,010
It's not going to look too good until we get to the styling.

21
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,650
But for the other two.

22
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,070
So that's our first rating div and then we have two more.

23
00:01:58,410 --> 00:01:59,960
So I'm just going to paste these in.

24
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,990
OK, so we have the first one here.

25
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,340
We have the second one which is neutral, which is a different image, and then we have this one here

26
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,140
satisfied and noticed.

27
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,750
The last one does have the active class on it.

28
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,390
So it'll have the outline.

29
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,080
So let's save that.

30
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,340
But we'll have the outline once we have the success.

31
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,270
Right now, it's just going to look like this, OK?

32
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,850
And then at the bottom, let's see.

33
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:33,960
We want to go outside of this div and this div and right above the ending panel contain or div and have

34
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,530
a button.

35
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,990
And I'm going to give this a class of B10 and let's give us an idea of send, because we're going to

36
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:49,110
need to add an event listener in the JavaScript onto that and we'll say send or view and that's it for

37
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,730
the HTML.

38
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:54,990
So let's jump into our stylesheet here and for a font we're going to use Monserrat.

39
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,630
So I'm going to just right here.

40
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,920
It ends with success.

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,550
Will do Questionmark family equals Monserrat.

42
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,620
And let's add that to the body.

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:19,180
OK, and for this stuff here, we're going to display flags and we actually don't need the Flex Direction

44
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,440
column, we do want to align center and height 100 viewport.

45
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,180
That's good.

46
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:30,940
And let's start on the panel container, which wraps around everything.

47
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,110
So panel container is going to have a background color of white.

48
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:47,820
And actually, one thing I want to do on the body is out of background, so on the body will say background

49
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:54,790
color and this is going to be hexadecimal value F F nine, f two.

50
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,330
So just like, great.

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,020
And you can you can barely see the difference.

52
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,200
So you can see the background.

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,550
It's almost like a very, very light tan color.

54
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:14,040
And I also want to add a box shadow on the panel container so we'll do zero zero for the offsets and

55
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,790
then 10 pixel blur and then GBA for the color, which is going to be black.

56
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,680
Zero zero zero and then zero point three.

57
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:30,450
OK, so you can see we just have this slight box, shadow border radius.

58
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:39,560
So I want this to have rounded corners just slightly, so do four pixels, border radius, and let's

59
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,620
set the font size of the text in here to a default of 90 percent.

60
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,330
And I want to display flaks.

61
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,450
As soon as I do that, it's going to look like this.

62
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,030
We don't want this.

63
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:54,860
We don't want to row.

64
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,610
We want these to be, you know, on top of each other.

65
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,440
So we'll set the flex direction to call them instead of Roe, which is going to make it look similar

66
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,460
to how it just did.

67
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,220
But we want to justify content center.

68
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,880
We want to align items center.

69
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,370
And let's go ahead and add some padding to this container.

70
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:19,370
So 30 pixels padding, take everything away from the edges.

71
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:29,120
Let's add a max width of 400 pixels here and let's text a line to the center, which I'm actually going

72
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,980
to put up here.

73
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,770
So next, we're just going to increase the line height of this right here, which I believe that's a

74
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,730
strong tag.

75
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:41,510
So, yeah, we just have that wrapped and strong.

76
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:48,800
So let's say panel container strong and let's set the line height to twenty pixels.

77
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:56,640
And then we're going to start to style the ratings, so ratings container wraps around this, the three

78
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,880
faces here, three boxes.

79
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,730
So it's a ratings Dasch container.

80
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:11,130
And for that, we want to display as a flex box, OK?

81
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,570
We want that as a flex row.

82
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,850
And then for margin here, let's do 20 pixels on the top and bottom.

83
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:26,360
Now, for each rating, remember, we have the class of rating and I'm going to set I want them all

84
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,620
to be equal columns, so let's use flex one for all of them.

85
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:36,260
And then we're going to set the cursor to a pointer because we're going to be clicking on them and then

86
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,860
padding.

87
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:41,780
Let's do 20 pixels all around, kind of separate them out.

88
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:46,820
And then for margin, let's do 10 pixels, top and bottom, five pixels left and right.

89
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,890
All right.

90
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,710
Now let's handle the hover.

91
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:54,560
We want to have that the box around it when we hover.

92
00:06:54,950 --> 00:07:00,860
Also, we want to make it when we click on it so the box stays on it for the hover and active.

93
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:06,070
Let's do a class of rating and hover.

94
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,480
We also want this on the class of rating when it has a class of active.

95
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:22,040
So I'm going to set the border radius to four pixels and we're going to we're not going have a border,

96
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,360
we're going to have a box shadow.

97
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:32,410
So box shadow, let's do zero zero 10 pixels, our GPA and zero zero zero.

98
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,250
So red, green, blue zero and then zero point one for the alpha.

99
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:39,590
And you can see that the active one has that box around it.

100
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:43,010
And if I hover over any of them, it has that box as well.

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,190
Now the image.

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:52,820
So let's take the image that's in the rating class rating div and let's give that a width of 40 pixels.

103
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,950
It's going to make them a little smaller.

104
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,800
We also have the small tags which has the, you know, unhappy, neutral, satisfied, so let's say

105
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,840
rating small.

106
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,820
And I'm just going to change the color of that to five, five, five.

107
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:17,630
And let's set that to display in dash and block because these are small tags are inline by default.

108
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,760
And then I just want to add a margin to, say, 10 pixels, zero zero.

109
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,080
That'll push them down a little bit.

110
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,340
And then if it's active, I just want to change the color of the small to make it a little lighter.

111
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:34,850
So let's just take this.

112
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,850
So hover or small, I'm sorry, hover or active, but oops.

113
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:51,620
And then we just want to target the small tags for that and set that color to hexadecimal.

114
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,490
One, one, one.

115
00:08:54,730 --> 00:09:04,780
OK, and then for the button style that so that has a class of buttons and set the background color

116
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:16,360
of that to hexadecimal value of three zero to D to be OK, it's going to be our background color.

117
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:23,470
So we want the color of the text to be white and let's set the border to zero.

118
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:30,730
Let's set the border radius to four pixels like everything else needs a little padding.

119
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:38,650
So we'll do padding 12 pixels top and bottom, 30 pixels left and right and make the cursor into a pointer.

120
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,690
OK, good.

121
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:49,160
Let's get rid of that outlines or say, class of BTN when it's in its focus state, we want to set the

122
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,470
outline to zero.

123
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:53,840
All right.

124
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,500
And then let's do big BTN.

125
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,730
And when it's in its active state, we'll go ahead and add a transform property and let's just scale

126
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,480
it down a little.

127
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:09,050
So from one, we'll go to nine point ninety.

128
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,320
So we just get that little, you know, scale down effect.

129
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:20,960
Now we can't see it just yet, but once we basically submit this form using JavaScript, we're going

130
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,590
to have an icon from font awesome.

131
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,090
Inserted with some text.

132
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,540
So I just want to add this style for that.

133
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,810
It's going to be a dash heart.

134
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,220
It's going to be the class for the icon.

135
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:40,820
I just want to make it red so color red and the font size, I'm going to make it bigger 30 pixels and

136
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,990
just set margin bottom just to push the content below it down.

137
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,430
Set that to 10 pixels.

138
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,240
OK, and that's it for this VSS so pretty simple.

139
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:56,960
In the next video, we're going to add the functionality where we can click and we can change the active

140
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,110
class and give it the the border, the or the box shadow.

141
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,790
And also so we can click this and it'll show us a page that basically says thank you.

142
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,440
You know, thank you for your feedback.

143
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,040
All right.

144
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,150
So we'll get into that next.
