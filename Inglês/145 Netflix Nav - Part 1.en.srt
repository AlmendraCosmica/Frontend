1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,880
All right, so we're going to get started on our Netflix branded navigation here, so I have my products

2
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:11,730
Storrar I do have a link to the font awesome CDN because we will be using two icons from font.

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,300
Awesome.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,190
So down in the body, who actually gets to the title first.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:22,650
So in the title here and it changes to Netflix, mobile navigation.

6
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,290
That's the name of the project.

7
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,860
And then down here we're going to first have our open button.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,100
So let's add a button here.

9
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,410
And this is going to have two classes, NAV, Dash, BTN, which is going to be on both the open and

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:45,150
close and then open Dash BTN and we're going to use an icon with the class of facts and then a dash

11
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,070
Barzeh, which will give us a hamburger menu, hamburger menu icon.

12
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:55,140
So under that we're going to have the image, the logo, the Netflix logo is going to go in the middle

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,860
of the page.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,080
It's also going to go in the NAV itself.

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,130
So we'll have two of them.

16
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,600
But let's say image with the class of a logo and the AltX will just say logo and then the source is

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,490
going to come from a remote link.

18
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,080
You can, of course download any logo or any image and put it in here.

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:19,950
But I'm just going to link to this Netflix logo and then let's do a paragraph with the class of text.

20
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:23,910
And I just want that to say mobile navigation.

21
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,310
So this is just the content that's going to go in the middle.

22
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,220
And right now the logo is huge.

23
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,500
In fact, I'm just going to add in the stylesheet real quick logo and let's say with one hundred and

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,670
fifty pixels.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,020
All right.

26
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,810
Just so we can actually see stuff now, underneath that, under the paragraph is where we're going to

27
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,310
have our navigation is going to be three separate parts that that slide out.

28
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,370
You're going to have the red, white and black.

29
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,120
So what we're going to what we're going to do is have three NAV classes.

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:01,170
The first one is also going to have nav dash black and then inside that will have another nav class

31
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:10,700
with a class of nav dash red and then another one with nav and let's to nav dash black, not black.

32
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,970
We already did black white.

33
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,670
So the white is where the actual content is going to go, the, the links and stuff.

34
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,370
First thing I'm going to put in here is the close button so that have a class of nav btn just like the

35
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:31,200
open and then let's do close dash BTN as well and we'll use eFax for a dash times.

36
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,060
OK, so there's a close button and underneath the button is going to be another image for our logo.

37
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,720
So I'm just going to grab this here and put that here.

38
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:52,330
OK, and then we want our our links or our menu items, so we're going to have a you Alan Unnoted list

39
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:57,370
with a class of list and let's do an ally here with a link inside of it.

40
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,230
Link doesn't have to go anywhere.

41
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,690
And this will say teams.

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,210
We're going to have three here to begin with.

43
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:13,660
So teams, locations and let's say life at Netflix.

44
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,630
Now, within this, we're going to have a nested well.

45
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,060
So let's put another list item here.

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,220
But inside that will have a pool and a list item with a link.

47
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:30,100
And this is going to say Netflix culture.

48
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,390
Memmo, we're going to make all these uppercase using access so it doesn't matter if you make these

49
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,860
lower case or upper case.

50
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,540
So let's see, we have that and then we have work life balance.

51
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,450
Then we're going to do.

52
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:58,580
Inclusion and diversity and blog.

53
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,460
All right, so those are links, so it doesn't look very good, but we're going to go ahead and style

54
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:04,810
it now.

55
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,960
So let's jump in here.

56
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,860
And I'm not sure if we'll get to all the success in this video.

57
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,960
We might have to do the rest in the next one.

58
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:14,120
But let's start here with the fonts.

59
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,400
I'm going to use the Mieuli font.

60
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,070
So it's a question mark family and set that to them.

61
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,910
You apply and then we'll add that down here.

62
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:32,240
And maybe I could display Fleck's column.

63
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,930
That's good.

64
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,960
Height 100 viewport heights.

65
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:42,140
We don't really need an overflow and then we don't really need margin zero because we want it to be,

66
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,420
you know, right at the edge here.

67
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,300
So that should be good for the body.

68
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:50,180
The this text that's in the main part of the page.

69
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,850
I want that to be uppercase.

70
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,280
So we're going to say text transform, set that to uppercase.

71
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,720
And then that's I mean, that's pretty much it for the entire page.

72
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,220
Of course, you could put whatever you want here.

73
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,420
So we just have, you know, the where is it up here, the image in the text.

74
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:15,530
But you would have your page content here and then have the menu down here.

75
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,330
So next thing I want to do is the NAV button, which is this one here.

76
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,880
I want to position it up here, make it look a little better.

77
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:33,170
So let's add nav dash button and let's take away the borders of water.

78
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:33,680
None.

79
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,070
And this applies to both buttons.

80
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,350
So bored or none.

81
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,630
And then the background, we want to get rid of that grey.

82
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,000
So we're going to set it to transparent.

83
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,450
We're also going to make sure the cursor is a pointer.

84
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,170
And let's set the font size to a little bit bigger.

85
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,220
Twenty pixels.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,160
So that's the nav button, which is on both.

87
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,880
Now let's do just the open button, so open dash button.

88
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:03,110
And for that we want to position that fixed within the viewport.

89
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,610
So position fixed.

90
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,880
And I want it to be ten pixels from the top and ten pixels from the left which is going to place it

91
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,200
right up here in the corner.

92
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,610
So for the nav now remember this three NAVs here.

93
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:26,240
So we're going to style the nav and then each color because it's going to come out to a certain point

94
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,920
so we can see all three colors.

95
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:38,690
So let's do the nav first so the nav class and that's going to be position fixed and we want it to be

96
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,610
right, right in the top corner.

97
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:44,540
So top zero left zero.

98
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,510
OK, so you're going to see that move up if you save.

99
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,620
And then the height of this is going to be the entire viewport.

100
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,300
So 100 viewport heights.

101
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,380
All right.

102
00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:02,990
And then as far as you know, the sliding effect here, the way we do that is with a transition on the

103
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:11,270
transform property using translate excuse, translate X effects, you know, moving along the X axis,

104
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,040
which is the horizontal axis.

105
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,860
So let's add a transform here and let's say we want to translate on the x axis.

106
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,830
And to start off, we want it to be way over to the left off the screen, which will do negative one

107
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,100
hundred percent, which brings it off the screen now to have it come in.

108
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,790
What's going to happen is we're going to add the class of visible to each of these.

109
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,380
I'm just going to add it manually now.

110
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:41,390
But later on, we'll remove this and we'll just have it done with JavaScript.

111
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,340
But just so we can see it, we're going to set visible on all three of those, make sure it's on all

112
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:46,820
three.

113
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,640
And then what we'll do is take NAV.

114
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:58,970
And if it has a class of visible, then I'm going to copy this transform here and set it back to its

115
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,740
normal position, which is zero.

116
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,760
So now we can see it because visible is on all three of those.

117
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,730
Now we want it to have a smooth transition when it switches from this to this and back.

118
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,800
So we'll set a transition on the transform property.

119
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,760
And let's do point three seconds for the duration.

120
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,970
So how long it takes and then ease in out.

121
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:23,780
All right.

122
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,660
So I think that that's all we're going to do in this video.

123
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,400
And the next one will continue with the styling and then we'll add the JavaScript so we can make the

124
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,560
the open and close buttons function.
