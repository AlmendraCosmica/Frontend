1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,040
We're going to get started on our vertical slide.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:10,080
And I have my browser window quite wide because this isn't really responsive just because of the orientation

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,850
of the how the slider is.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:15,080
So it's not going to look good on like a smartphone or anything like that.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,880
That's not really what this is geared for.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,550
So I'm going to just keep this a little wider and just click back and forth for now in our HTML, we

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:29,520
just have a product project starter and I have a link to the font awesome CDN because we will be using

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,830
icons for the buttons.

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:40,830
So let's start off here and change this to vertical slider and then we're going to have a container

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:42,320
that wraps around everything.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's give this div a class of slider dash container and there's basically three three separate parts.

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,570
First we have the left dash slide.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,350
So this is going to be the text area.

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:06,030
So we'll have an H1 and a paragraph and then the right slide and I'll fill this fill this in in a little

15
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,300
bit.

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,170
But the right slide is going to be the images.

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:10,430
Right?

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,080
So they're just basically it's going to be digits background images.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,570
And then underneath that, we want our buttons.

20
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,380
So let's say action dash buttons.

21
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:29,400
And our first button here is going to have a class of down dash button and I'm going to use font awesome

22
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:29,880
icon.

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,520
So Fayaz And we want a dash arrow dash down.

24
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,210
OK, so go ahead and save that weight.

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:41,610
Is that right now Faez space.

26
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,090
Narrowed down and then for the up arrow, we'll just take this button, copy it down, and we'll change

27
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,000
this to up and change this icon to up.

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,130
And now we have our buttons.

29
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:04,170
So for the left side, let's go into that div and we're just going to have a bunch of divs with in each

30
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,530
one.

31
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:13,830
So for this one will say nature flower and a paragraph will say all in pink.

32
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:19,350
And then each div is going to have an inline style with a background color.

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,050
So that way when you want to add new slides or new divs, you just throw the background color in here

34
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,380
rather than creating a whole separate class for it.

35
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,410
So let's say background color and we'll make it F.D. three five five five.

36
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,360
So I save it.

37
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,010
We're going to see that now.

38
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,610
We're going to have three more of these, which I'm just going to paste in because it's the same thing.

39
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,430
It's just different colors and content.

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:51,420
So if I save that, you can see what we have here now for the right slide is going to be just a bunch

41
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,860
of background images.

42
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,600
So I'm going to grab that.

43
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,660
And I'm just using links to splash images, just to stock images.

44
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:05,400
So you can see we have a div with a background image, you URL and we have for these.

45
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,500
Now, if I save, we're not going to see these right now because we don't have any content within the

46
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,070
div and there's no height or with applied to to the element.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,380
So we're not going to see the images just yet.

48
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:22,200
Now one thing I want to mention is because of the way the slides, one side goes up, one side goes

49
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,850
down, we have this first div, this nature flower is actually going to go with the last image div here.

50
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:30,540
All right.

51
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:36,930
So if I look at this last image, I'm just going to copy that you URL and paste that and you can see

52
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,160
that's the pink flower.

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,700
So the way you would do this, if you want to add more, is if you add one on to the end here, you're

54
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,830
going to add one on to the beginning here.

55
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,180
OK, see the beat.

56
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,610
The last one here is Flying Eagle.

57
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,680
And if we take a look at this, we get the Flying Eagle.

58
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,120
So that's the order of the elements.

59
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,920
So now let's jump into our success and let's get started here.

60
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,090
So as far as the font goes, I'm going to use open sans.

61
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:18,480
So let's say family equals open plus sans and we're going to change this to open Sans, OK, and I can

62
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:24,270
make this smaller here, so make that smaller and make this a little smaller for now.

63
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,050
Now the body we actually don't need all this stuff like display flex.

64
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,280
I just want the, the font family and I want the height to be 100 viewport heights.

65
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,500
So it's going to go like that right now.

66
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,530
And I want to just set a reset on the margin and padding.

67
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,280
So for the universal selector will set margin padding to zero.

68
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,220
That's going to remove the margin and padding from everything.

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,160
Now, as far as the slider container goes, which is wrapped around everything.

70
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,850
So the slider container, I'm going to set the position to relative, because we're going to be setting

71
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:09,270
everything inside of it as absolute within that container and then just set in the overflow to hidden

72
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,920
and set the width to 100 viewport widths.

73
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,790
So VW, which will take the hole with and same with the height.

74
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,220
This is going to be vague.

75
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,250
Report heights.

76
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,480
All right.

77
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,750
And then we'll go ahead and start on the left slide.

78
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:36,250
So for the left side, I want to set the height to 100 percent and let's set the clock.

79
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,340
Let's do the width first.

80
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:43,240
So the width is going to be 35 percent of the container.

81
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:50,130
OK, the image part is going to be a little bigger, it's the image power will be 65 percent and we're

82
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:59,220
going to position this absolute and from the top zero, from the left zero.

83
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:05,570
And then what we want to do is target the immediate division side, which are each of these here.

84
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,740
So let's say left slide, immediate div.

85
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:19,150
And I want to set for that the height, for I want the height to be the entire thing, so one of these

86
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,740
should take up the entire height.

87
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:27,010
So there will be 100 to 100 percent and then width will be 100 percent.

88
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,360
But it's 100 percent of its container, which is 35 percent.

89
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:37,260
So if I save that now, we can see this nature flower and it takes up the entire height here.

90
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:41,900
And when we add the slide functionality, it'll show the next one.

91
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,890
Now, we want to style this a little better.

92
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,480
So let's display flex so each div will be display flex.

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,900
Now it's in a row right now.

94
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,580
That's why it's it's it's horizontal.

95
00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:02,710
So we want to change the flex direction to a column and then we can align both horizontally and vertically.

96
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:11,440
So align center line item center and then let's justify content center and that'll align it that way.

97
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,310
And then let's also make the color white.

98
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:27,760
OK, and then let's grab the H1, so left slide H1 and let's set the font size to be a little bigger.

99
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,970
We're going to set that to 40 pixels and we'll add a little bit of margin bottom because remember,

100
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:38,250
we took the margin off of everything, 10 pixels to separate it from the paragraph part.

101
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,410
And then I just want to move it up a little bit.

102
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,170
So margin top offset a negative margin, 30 pixels, which will pull it up a little bit.

103
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:56,640
All right, so that's the left slide now, the right slide, right slide and the set, the height to

104
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:08,640
100 percent on that position, absolute from the top zero and then from the left, I'm going to go thirty

105
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,990
five percent because this with this thirty five percent.

106
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:15,840
So for the right slide, I'm positioning an absolute within the container.

107
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,340
So I want to start it here, which would be 35 percent over from the left.

108
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:21,780
All right.

109
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,320
And then we want to set the width of it to sixty five percent.

110
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,020
OK, and then.

111
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:39,630
To actually show the image, let's target the device, so Rightside directive and I just want to set

112
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:45,270
some background properties like background repeat so that no repeat, we already have the background

113
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,220
image set in line.

114
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:47,520
Right.

115
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,980
That's already set right here.

116
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,650
So I just want to add some other background properties like the size.

117
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,420
So what's the background?

118
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,040
Size is going to be cover.

119
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:04,310
I want to show the whole image and then background position is going to be centered on the X and Y axis.

120
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,840
We still can't see it because we need to apply a height to it.

121
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:14,520
So height and width are going to both be 100 percent.

122
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,200
So it takes up the whole part there.

123
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,910
And now we can see the image.

124
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,710
Now, this isn't the image that we actually want to show with this nature flower.

125
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:29,310
But like I said, since the way that we're sliding them in, when we get to our JavaScript, we're going

126
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:33,960
to set it so that this is the right text or the right left slide for this image.

127
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,290
But for now, let's go ahead and style our buttons.

128
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,680
So we're going to have some general button styles.

129
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:50,040
But before we do that, I just want to target the slider container action, what I call it action,

130
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,700
dash, Fortin's and Button.

131
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,290
And I mean, we could put the general styling in here as well.

132
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,830
But just in case you wanted to add other buttons somewhere.

133
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,550
So this is going to be positioned absolutes.

134
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:11,670
And as soon as I do that, you can see up here now there's there's two buttons here, but they're both

135
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,410
in the same exact spot right now.

136
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,020
I'm going to move both to a position of left 35 percent.

137
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,210
OK, so it's going to push them over and then let's go from the top will go down about halfway, we'll

138
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,620
say 50 percent down.

139
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,300
So now both buttons are right here and we want to make sure they're always on top.

140
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,570
So let's do a Z index of one.

141
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,420
All right.

142
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:39,780
And then for the down button.

143
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:48,030
So let's grab this here and say class down dash button.

144
00:10:51,390 --> 00:11:01,020
I'm going to set a border, actually, let's let's position it first so we can use, transform and then

145
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:07,210
translate on the x axis, because what I want to do is move this button over this way to the left.

146
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:13,220
So if we put a positive number in here, I'm going to just do 100 percent of the element.

147
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,640
It's going to move it over to the left, which I don't want.

148
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,790
I want it over to the right.

149
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,200
So that's going to be I'm sorry.

150
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,550
That's going to move it to the right.

151
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,610
I want it to the left.

152
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:23,060
So that's going to be negative.

153
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,070
So now it's on either side of this line right here.

154
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,120
All right.

155
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,930
And then as far as the borders go.

156
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:39,570
Actually, you know what, we'll do that in a second, let's first do the up button, so this one is

157
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,060
going to be a button and we want to actually move this one down.

158
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,420
So we're going to do translate.

159
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,050
Why?

160
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,040
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,700
Now move it down.

162
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,420
Move it up.

163
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,280
This one here, I want to move up one hundred percent, so we'll do negative one hundred percent.

164
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:58,460
So now you can see the positioning of these arrows now for the styling.

165
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,990
So the general button styling.

166
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:11,640
Let's go up here to button and let's set a background color of white and let's get rid of the border.

167
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:20,880
So border none and let's make the color a gray will do triple J and let's make the cursor a pointer.

168
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,700
Let's make the font size a little bigger.

169
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:30,870
We'll do sixteen pixels, let's do padding fifteen pixels all the way around.

170
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:41,790
OK, so you can see it looks a little nicer and on hover it's a button however said the color to two

171
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,020
to two just a little darker and we don't want any outline.

172
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:53,660
So any button in the focus state we want to set the outline to none.

173
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,270
All right.

174
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,400
Now if we hover over, it gets darker.

175
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:02,910
I do want to have some rounded corners on the bottom for this one and for the top for this one.

176
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,690
So down where we have these down and up buttons, let's just add on the down button.

177
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,740
We'll say border.

178
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,500
We're going to say border.

179
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,860
This is the down button.

180
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:27,030
So let's do top top left radius and set that to five pixels so you can see that this has the rounded

181
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,960
corners here.

182
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:34,620
And then we're going to do bottom left radius.

183
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,030
So now this side is rounded.

184
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,210
I want to do the same on this one, but the opposite side.

185
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,890
So I'll just copy that.

186
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:48,960
And instead of left, let's take this and this.

187
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,880
Change that to right.

188
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:58,090
I said, now, those buttons look pretty good, OK, and it's obviously this doesn't do anything yet

189
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,470
because we need to add our JavaScript, so that's what we're going to do in the next video.
