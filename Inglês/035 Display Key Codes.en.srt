1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,430
OK, so now we want to add the Java scripts for this project, and before we do anything, I just want

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:13,240
to add the event listener and show you how we get these actual properties like Qiqi code and code.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:20,910
So let's let's take the window, which is the top level object in the browser, and we're going to add

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:22,680
an event listener on to that.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,350
And the event we want to listen for is a key down, which is a keyboard event.

6
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:34,620
And we pass in a function as a second second argument here.

7
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,640
And then in this function, we can pass an event object.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,580
And then I just want to console log that event, object to show you what it gives us.

9
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:45,450
So one of my console just reload here.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,330
And if I hit the letter A or the A, you're going to see I get a bunch of properties.

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:01:00,090
And what I want to show you is, for one, the keek are I'm sorry, the code which is Keet.

12
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,450
So that value we want to get put in here and then we also have to go down here a little more.

13
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:13,050
We have the actual key which is a that's going to go in there and then we should also have the key code

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,750
or are the code.

15
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,800
No code is Keet, whereas the key code

16
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,330
here it is right underneath.

17
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,500
So key code is 65.

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,940
Now, if I hit another key like Q that's going to give me another oops, I going to go up here and hit

19
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,070
it.

20
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:37,290
So here you can see I get the key of Q The code is key.

21
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:42,000
Q And the key code is 81.

22
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,140
So we want that stuff to be put in these boxes, which is going to be pretty easy.

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,290
And then actually one more thing I want to show you.

24
00:01:49,740 --> 00:02:00,380
If I hit space, the actual key is the code is space, but the actual key is just an empty string.

25
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,510
So I just want to do a simple check to see if the key is equal to an empty string.

26
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:11,310
If it is, then we'll go ahead and just put the word space in there, because I don't want it to just

27
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,990
be blank.

28
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:23,190
So what we'll do is, first of all, bring in insert so document get element by D and we want to bring

29
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:33,270
in the idea of insert and let's get rid of that and we're going to take insert and say in our HTML because

30
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,930
that's how we can insert HTML and make sure you use back tactics here so that this is we can put dynamic

31
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,870
values in here.

32
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:48,090
Now I'm going to copy from indexed HTML the three divs with the class of key, not the last one with

33
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,950
just the text, but these three here.

34
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,350
I'm going to cut them, not copy them, because we don't want those in there initially and save and

35
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,390
now you're only going to see this one box.

36
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,770
So in this, in our HTML value, in this template literal, I'm going to paste the sin but I want to

37
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,740
change these.

38
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,320
These are basically just hardcoded a right here.

39
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:16,040
I want to change that to the key which we can get from E key.

40
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,800
Now remember, this is going to be just an empty string if it's space.

41
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:29,100
So what I'll do is just do a quick check will say if a key is equal to just an empty string, then let's

42
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,980
put out space or else let's put out whatever the key is.

43
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,060
So it's key.

44
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,630
And this is just a ternary it's just a shorthand conditional.

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,540
Whatever you're testing goes here, which in our case, testing to see if he equals an empty string.

46
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:54,810
This is basically, you know, then so if this then puts put out space or else so this represents else,

47
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,760
then just whatever the key is.

48
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,970
OK, and then down here we have our key code.

49
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:06,570
So let's say and this syntax is just, you know, a template literal of money sign and curly braces.

50
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,490
As long as you're in back ticks and not quotes, then you can use the syntax.

51
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:18,180
So we want to take the object or the event object and let's say dot key code.

52
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,530
OK, now there's a line through it and VTS code because it is deprecated, but it will still show up.

53
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,490
It will still work.

54
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,180
If you're watching this in the future and it doesn't work, then you can just get rid of this block

55
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,030
if you want and just show the code.

56
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:44,160
So for this last one here, let's say e dot code actually since we put a vent here, let's just change

57
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,410
because this can be absolutely anything you want.

58
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:47,820
We'll change this to events.

59
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:54,990
And that way, I don't know, just because we used event there doesn't really matter.

60
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,220
But so event key.

61
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:07,430
And when you see other people's code, you might see you might see event, you might see Eevee, that's

62
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,480
also pretty common.

63
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,550
So now I'm going to save this.

64
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,280
And if I go over here and I hit enter, you can see that the key I hit is enter.

65
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:25,910
The key code is 13 and the code is enter by hit a we're going to get a 65 K if I hit three three fifty

66
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,410
one digit three.

67
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,180
OK, so it's working.

68
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:33,440
If we had space we're going to see space here because of this check we did hear.

69
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,600
Otherwise it would just be an empty string.

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,640
So it would just be empty and we don't want that.

71
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:45,410
OK, there's a backwards capsular shift so any key you hit, it's going to give you the key code and

72
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:45,860
the code.

73
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,580
All right.

74
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,170
So I know this is a really simple project, but it's nice to just get going.

75
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:56,300
And it can also be useful if you need the code for something, if you're building a game or whatever

76
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:56,840
it might be.

77
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,590
All right.

78
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,140
So thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next project.
