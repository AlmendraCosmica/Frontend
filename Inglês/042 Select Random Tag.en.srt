1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,850
OK, so we're able to create our tags here with commas.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:06,590
Now we want the random select functionality.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,730
So in our event listener, let's check to see if we hit enter.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:18,330
So we'll say if and then on this event object, we have a key property and we're going to say if the

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,940
key is equal to enter.

6
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,200
All right.

7
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:29,070
Now, if we hit enter, we're going to call a function called Random Select, which we haven't created

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,320
yet.

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,230
I also want to clear the input.

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,650
So we're actually just going to wait a couple milliseconds before we do that.

11
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:43,470
So in the set, time will pass in an arrow function and we just want to wait 10 milliseconds and then

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:51,210
clear the input value with e dot target dot value, and we're just going to set that to nothing.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,290
All right.

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:01:02,220
So let's create random select down here, function, random, select, and for now we'll just console

15
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,450
log one, two, three.

16
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:09,840
And if I open up my console and you know, I can type stuff down here and then enter, then you see

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,880
it fires off that function.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,460
And it also clears this up here now in the random select, we're going to go ahead and set a value of

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,770
times and I'm going to set that to 30.

20
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:28,080
And what this represents is the number of times it's going to highlight each one before it stops.

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,730
So, you know, the one, two, three, four, and it'll go to thirty or whatever you put this to.

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,060
And then we're going to have we're going to have to set an interval, because this is going to repeat

23
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,910
this highlight of each one, the highlight and the remove of highlight of each one.

24
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:51,890
So let's create a variable called interval and we want to use the set interval function.

25
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:59,910
So for the for the time here, we want this to happen, let's say, every 100 milliseconds.

26
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:04,890
And what we want to happen is we want to pick a random tag.

27
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:13,890
So let's say conse random tag and set that to a function called pick random tag.

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:25,960
And before we move on, we'll create that so it's a function pick random tag and we want to take all

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:33,160
the tags so we can use document, dot, query, selector, all, and we want to get all the elements

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,540
of the class of tag, which would be all these, all of these, all the spans.

31
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,260
And then to get a random one, let's return.

32
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:50,820
And we're going to return tags, so tags when we use query selector all, it's a node list that we bring

33
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,080
in.

34
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,070
So all of these will be put into the node list, which is similar to an array with an index.

35
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,840
So the index is going to be random and we'll use math dot floor to round down math dot random, which

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,310
will give us a random decimal.

37
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:13,740
We just want to multiply that by the length of the tags array or not array, but no lists, which is

38
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,850
similar to an array.

39
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,220
So that'll give us a random tag.

40
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,750
I'm also going to create two more functions down here just to highlight and highlight.

41
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:31,710
So we'll call this highlight tag and it's going to take in a specific tag element and then we're going

42
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:39,060
to take that tag element and we're going to just add a out of class with classless dot ad and we're

43
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,250
going to add the highlight class and then we want one to remove the highlights.

44
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,490
So we'll call this on highlight tag and we're just going to remove instead of add.

45
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,520
Base.

46
00:03:53,670 --> 00:04:00,590
Now back up to here, so we have this intervale, it's going to fire off every 100 milliseconds, it's

47
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,180
going to pick a random tag, and then we want to highlight that random tag.

48
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:13,060
So highlight tag pass in our random tag and then we want to highlight.

49
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,430
So I'm going to have a set time out here, which is going to take in a function and we're just going

50
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:24,090
to wait 100 milliseconds here to highlight.

51
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:31,310
OK, so in here we'll say on highlight tag and want to pass in our random tags.

52
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:39,500
So with this, if I were to create my tags and then hit enter, you can see what's happening every 100

53
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,270
milliseconds.

54
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,360
It's highlight's picking a random tag to start at and then it's highlighting a random tag and then 100

55
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
milliseconds after it's on highlighting.

56
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,860
So that's just going to keep going forever right now.

57
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,170
All right.

58
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:54,980
I'm just going to reload to stop that.

59
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:58,730
And now what we can do is go under.

60
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:09,350
So function, we still want to be within our random select, but we want to go down here and I'm going

61
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:19,490
to have a set time out with a function and I want this to run after whatever the Times is.

62
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,270
I want to multiply that by 100 milliseconds.

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,630
So the 30 here, multiply that by whatever the time this is, which is 100 milliseconds.

64
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,910
OK, we could even put that we could put that in a separate variable if we wanted to, but anyway,

65
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,710
we want to clear our individual.

66
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,690
So you have an interval that runs.

67
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:45,150
There's a function called clear interval to stop it.

68
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,030
So we want to pass in our interval.

69
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,970
Then we want to pick a random tag to stop on.

70
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,220
So let's create let's do a set time.

71
00:05:55,010 --> 00:06:05,170
And this is going to be 100 milliseconds and inside the set time out, I want to get a random tag.

72
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:13,790
So once again, we'll create a random tag and set that to pick random tag and then we want to highlight

73
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:13,930
it.

74
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,460
So it's a highlight tag and pass in our random tag.

75
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:28,160
OK, so this up here is is causing that, you know, shifting it to each one, highlighting and highlighting

76
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,540
after a certain amount of time.

77
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:35,330
And then this takes care of stopping it and just picking a random tag to land on and highlight.

78
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,320
Hopefully that makes sense.

79
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,380
So let's do one, two, three, four, five.

80
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,440
These can be numbers or strings or whatever you want to put in here.

81
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,160
Let's do up to ten and then I'm going to hit enter.

82
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:57,260
So it should run 30 times and then it's going to stop on a random tag or in this case number.

83
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,060
But of course it can be anything.

84
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,190
And let's try that again.

85
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:05,390
Same thing which we did one through ten and hit enter.

86
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,220
So it landed on three last time.

87
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,320
Now it lands on one.

88
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:19,160
All right, so you have choice, one choice to choice, three, enter, and it's just a cool little

89
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,650
application to pick a random choice.

90
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,040
All right, so that's it.
