1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,510
All right, so we're going to get started on the case for this project, so I guess we'll just keep

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,410
the Roboto font.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,310
That's fine.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,910
And the body, we're going to add a background.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,380
All right.

6
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,990
Let's do a background color and it's going to be a light gray.

7
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,400
So hexadecimal e, c, f zero, F one.

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,170
It's going to be our background and we don't need Flex Direction column.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,690
And this other stuff should be fine.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:34,860
Now, let's just say for the image, we want that to have a max width of one hundred percent of its

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,520
container.

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,250
So that's going to shrink up that image.

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,380
And then let's start to add the styles for our card.

14
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,520
So the card, I want to give it a box shadow.

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:56,640
So we have our horizontal offsets to zero vertical, two pixels blur 10 pixels and color will be a black

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,670
with an opacity of zero point to you see the the outline here.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:05,940
All right.

18
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,880
Now we want to have some rounded corners on the card.

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:16,680
So I'm going to set the border radius to 10 pixels and let's add overflow and set that to hidden so

20
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,320
nothing comes out of its container.

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:30,320
And then I'm going to have a width of 350 pixels on the card and let's set the card header height.

22
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:34,040
I want to set that to 200 pixels.

23
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,210
And right now, the text is kind of over the image a little bit.

24
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,540
So let's styled the card header image.

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:02:00,000
So I'm going to just make sure Object Fit is set to cover and let's set the height to 100 percent of

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,460
its container and the width to 100 percent.

27
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,810
So now you can see that the text is no longer over the image.

28
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:14,970
Now the card content here say card contents.

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,280
So I'm going to set the background of that to white sheet.

30
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,610
We'll use background color.

31
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,650
And then I want to just set some padding to move everything away from the sides or do 30 pixels padding.

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:32,850
All right.

33
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,020
Now, the stuff that's in the card card content like the title, let's do that.

34
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:47,070
So card dash title, I'm going to give that a height of twenty pixels and a margin of zero.

35
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,290
And then the excerpt.

36
00:02:54,010 --> 00:03:02,260
So the excerpt, I'm going to give a color of hexadecimal 777, which is a great color, and then for

37
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,400
the margin, let's do 10 pixels, zero, 20 pixels.

38
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,300
So that's the excerpt now for the author of the wraps around all of this.

39
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:22,710
So author, I just want to display Fleck's, which automatically puts it into a flex row and then for

40
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,510
the profile image.

41
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,010
So profile dash image, remember, that's the div around the image.

42
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:35,280
So I am going to set the border radius to 50 percent because I want it to be rounded, although right

43
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,600
now that's on the div and the image is basically popping out of the div.

44
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,680
So we want to make sure we set overflow, we want to set overflow to hidden.

45
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:48,510
OK, so that'll make it rounded.

46
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,270
We also want to make it much smaller.

47
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:59,080
So let's set the height to 40 pixels and also the width to 40 pixels.

48
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,240
So now the last thing is the author info, which is around the name and the date.

49
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:12,450
So let's say author info, which I want to display as a flex box, but I want them to be on top of each

50
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:12,650
other.

51
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,980
So the flex direction is going to be a column instead of a row.

52
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,670
And then let's take any remaining content.

53
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:27,450
So justify content to be around each element of space around and let's add a margin left to move it

54
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,620
away from the image.

55
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,800
So 10 pixels that will move the text away.

56
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,650
And let's add a width of, let's say, one hundred pixels.

57
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:44,070
OK, and then for the small tag, we have author info small.

58
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:51,710
I just want to change the color to triple J, which is a grey and then add a little margin top.

59
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,080
So five pixels and then we go.

60
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,900
So now our card is styled.

61
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:03,840
So in the next video I want to create the animation effects and then ultimately this content, the images

62
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,940
in the text are going to come from the JavaScript.
