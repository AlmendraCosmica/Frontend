1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,580
All right, so we're going to get started on our auto taiping effect and we should be able to do it

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:06,890
in this one video.

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,000
So let's start with the TML call this auto text fact.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,810
And let's do an H1 here.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,600
We're just going to say starting dot, dot, dot, because the phrase it's going to be typed out is

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,290
going to be set in the JavaScript and then we'll add it to this H1 using this idea of text.

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,100
And then under that, we're going to have a div that's going to have the speed control.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:41,930
So we'll have a label for speed and speed colon and under Neath that will have an input.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:50,310
And this is going to be the type of number and the name is going to be speed and I.D. is also speed.

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,060
And I also want to set the initial value to be one.

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:01,530
And we can set a minimum tax on a number of fields so men will be one and then let's set Max to five

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:04,380
and we'll set the step value.

13
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,450
What set that to one?

14
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:10,290
So it just it just counts up by one if you hit the little arrow up or down.

15
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,070
All right.

16
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,030
So we'll save that.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,230
It's going to look like this.

18
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,130
And we're going to just add in our style here.

19
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:24,810
So the body let's add a background color and we're going to use dark samen for the background color

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,560
here and everything else we can leave.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,470
That's fine for the div.

22
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,500
So basically the you know, where we control the speed, let's change that.

23
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,610
I'm going to position that absolutes and I want that to be at the bottom.

24
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,110
So let's do 20 pixels up from the bottom.

25
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,860
So move it down there and then let's do a background, kind of like a transparent, almost transparent

26
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,580
background.

27
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,840
We'll use a black and zero point one.

28
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:08,310
And then let's add some padding to this, so 10 pixels, top and bottom, 20 pixels left and right,

29
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:16,980
and then let's set the font size to 18 pixels.

30
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:18,440
All right.

31
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,840
And then for the input itself, will just grab it by input.

32
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,430
Let's set the width of that to 50 pixels.

33
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,200
Let's set the padding.

34
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:34,210
We'll do five pixels and the font size I'm going to set.

35
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,870
Let's do 20 pixels.

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,300
Actually, that's kind of big.

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:44,840
Let's do 18 and then let's set the background of that.

38
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:49,590
I want to set that to a background color of dark salmon as well.

39
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,730
And then the border.

40
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,560
We're just going to get rid of that.

41
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,840
Okay.

42
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,460
And then let's text the line to the center.

43
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:04,950
And I think we should be good now for the focus.

44
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,850
Like, if I click in here, I want to get rid of this border, this outline.

45
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:15,150
So let's say for the input when it's in its focus state, let's set the outline to none.

46
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:16,980
All right.

47
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,000
So now we can, you know, increase this decrease at.

48
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:28,040
So let's jump in to our JavaScript, so let's start off by bringing in our text element.

49
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:33,510
So when we call this text Al and we want document get element Bindeez, and we're going to bring it

50
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:35,250
in by its idea of text.

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,610
We also want the speed so the the no input has an idea of speed.

52
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:49,410
So we'll call this speed element and then I'm going to create a text variable which will have the actual

53
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,100
text we want to type out, which I want to say we love programming.

54
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,030
And obviously that could be whatever you want.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,140
And then I'm going to initialize an index variable at one.

56
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:06,690
And this is going to pertain to where we are in the text because we're going to be typing it out one

57
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,110
by one and then also the speed.

58
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,880
So I'm going to say let's speed.

59
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,980
And you could set this in many different ways.

60
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,430
I'm going to just take three hundred and divide it by whatever the value of this is.

61
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,710
So we'll take the speed element and we can get the value with value.

62
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:31,770
So it'll be, you know, start out with three hundred divided by one or 300, divide by two and that's

63
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,660
going to make it faster as we increase it.

64
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,250
Now we're going to initially call a function called write text.

65
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,890
So we want to create that function.

66
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:54,210
And we want to take the text element and set the entire text, too, and then we will start off with

67
00:04:54,210 --> 00:05:00,480
just the W in this case, because it's going to be the first letter in the string so we can take the

68
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:08,820
text, which is we love programming and then call dot, slice and with slice we can get a certain range

69
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,630
of the string.

70
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:17,370
So I want to get from zero to one in this case, which the index, which the index starts at 1:00.

71
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,690
All right.

72
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,840
So if I save that, we're just going to see a W on the screen.

73
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,980
Now, after we do that, we want to take the index and increment it by one.

74
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,460
So adding a plus plus just sets.

75
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,850
You know, if it's out one, it's going to go to two and three, four and so on.

76
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,620
Sharlie, you guys know that.

77
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,280
And then I just want to check to see if it's the end of the string that we're typing out so we can test

78
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:50,820
and see if the index is greater than the text length, which is going to be the entire length of whatever

79
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,660
we have here.

80
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,190
If that's true, then I'm going to just reset the index to one.

81
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,510
So it just will start over.

82
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,700
You don't have to do that.

83
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,890
You could just stop it or whatever.

84
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,830
But we're just going to have to keep going now.

85
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,790
We need this to keep happening, right?

86
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,470
So we need to keep calling this right text.

87
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:15,960
So inside here, let's call a set time out and we want we want to call.

88
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,290
Right.

89
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,550
Text would set time out.

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,190
Does is it runs a specific function in this case.

91
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:26,190
Write text and then it'll wait a specific amount of time.

92
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,480
So I could say like 100 milliseconds or 1000 milliseconds which would be one second.

93
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,660
Now I don't want this to be hard coded.

94
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,640
I want to wait whatever the speed is.

95
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,180
OK, so whatever that speed is, is what we want to set as a second argument to set time, OK?

96
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,790
Now, if I save this, it's going to go ahead and start to type out.

97
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,870
So it's basically just calling this and then when it hits the end, it starts over because we reset

98
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:52,920
the index to one.

99
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:57,170
And I could set this to anything I want up here.

100
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,330
So if I set the speed to a 1000, that's going to be every one second.

101
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,300
If I set it to, let's say 10000, it's going to be every ten seconds, 100 milliseconds.

102
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,300
That's going to be quicker.

103
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,820
But I'm going to keep it at that.

104
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,630
What I had of that.

105
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:17,820
And then for this, we want this to control, you know, how fast this goes.

106
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,100
So let's take the speed element and let's add an event listener on to it.

107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,460
Remember, the speed element is a no input, and I want to listen for any input, meaning if we type

108
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:37,470
the number in or if we use the arrow keys and then we'll have an arrow function here with our event

109
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,190
object.

110
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:46,710
And when this is called, we just want to set the speed equal to 300 divided by whatever the value is

111
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,000
here.

112
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,160
So e dot target, dot value.

113
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,870
OK, so it should happen, you know, in real time or whatever.

114
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,660
If I click to two it's going to start going faster.

115
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:05,910
If I click to three faster four, five and that's the max I can go because we set that max here.

116
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,060
If I set this to ten and I can type in here too.

117
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,620
So if I type in ten, you see how fast it goes.

118
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,280
If I type in five goes a little slower, if I type in one.

119
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:24,540
So I mean you probably wouldn't have this control on your actual website.

120
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,750
Like maybe you'd have a hero image with this, this effect.

121
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,450
You probably wouldn't give the speed effect as well.

122
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:36,630
But this is just for learning, you know, so you can learn how to add events and manipulate the DOM

123
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,670
and do little things like this.

124
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:46,860
But of course, this would be cool just to have in your your hero page, your hero banner or whatever

125
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,730
on your website.

126
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,930
So that's it.

127
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,760
I know this is a very short project.

128
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,140
Hopefully you enjoyed it.

129
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,790
If you want to add to it, maybe you could add an input up here or down here that you could type in

130
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,190
the text and it would change this.

131
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:07,200
And I might even do some videos later on where I take some of the projects we've already done and add

132
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,650
to it.

133
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,360
But I would suggest you do that on your own as well.

134
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,970
All right, enough rambling.

135
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,350
Let's move on to the next video.
