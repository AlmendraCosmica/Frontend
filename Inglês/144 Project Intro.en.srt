Hey, guys, welcome to your next project.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:08,280
So in this one, we're going to create a pretty cool mobile navigation effect, responsive navigation

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,900
hamburger menu, and we branded it Netflix mobile navigation.

4
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,580
But it's just because of the color scheme.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,900
It's not the actual Netflix menu, as far as I know.

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,760
But we basically just have a little hamburger menu up here, a little hamburger icon, I should say.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,810
And if we click it, we get this cool effect where there's three separate parts that come out in the

8
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:33,290
transition and some of them have delay.

9
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:38,240
So we have the black, red, white, and they come out and then when it goes in white, red, black.

10
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,130
So it's just a nice little effect.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,030
It's a clean looking menu.

12
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,030
Obviously, you could put whatever you want in the page.

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,250
We're just going to put the logo in context.

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,400
But this would be whatever you would want to put in the page.

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,770
And of course, if we make this really small still, you know, works the same way, looks good.

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,130
I think there's a minimum width of three twenty or so.

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,890
So it should look good on, you know, smartphones and so on.

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,610
So that's what we'll be building.

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,250
Let's go ahead and jump into it.
