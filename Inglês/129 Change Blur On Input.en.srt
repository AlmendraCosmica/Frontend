1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:05,520
OK, so now we want to add the JavaScript here, and this is this is actually an area where you could

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,720
pause the video and try to do this yourself.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,190
So basically, as we start to type, the longer the password length is, the less blurry we want the

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,910
image to be.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,000
And remember, it starts at 20 pixels.

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,310
So you essentially want to subtract from that 20 pixels, whatever the length of the password is, and

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,260
then multiply that by two.

8
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,860
That's going to be the the the math that will be using here.

9
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,590
So if you want to try it yourself, you can do that.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,150
But I'm going to go ahead and start and bring in, first of all, the password input.

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:48,060
So let's call this variable password and document Doggett's element by D and we should have an idea

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,050
of password.

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,270
Let me just double check, make sure I put that.

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:52,470
Yep.

15
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,880
So idea of password.

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:59,820
And the other thing we want is the background, which is this div here and that has an idea of background.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,790
So let's also grab that.

18
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:13,340
We'll call this background, all right, now we need an event listener on the password input, so let's

19
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,600
take that password input and let's add an event listener onto it.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,430
And we want to listen for any input and then fire off a function.

21
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:25,960
So I'm going to use an arrow function.

22
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,050
We're going to pass E in here the event parameter because we need to get the value.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:36,820
So let's say const input and let's set that to e target dot value.

24
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:43,070
OK, so that way we get the input and we'll just go ahead and test it with a console log here and let's

25
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:46,820
open up our console, get rid of that.

26
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,550
And as soon as I start to type it, we'll show whatever we're typing, whatever that input is.

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,260
Now, the next thing we want is the length of the input.

28
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:04,940
So let's create another variable here called length and set that to whatever the input dot length is.

29
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,100
And we can go ahead and console log the length here.

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:17,330
You see, it'll just give us the number, the length, and then we're going to take we're going to take

31
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:20,200
the the twenty.

32
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,390
That's what we have the blurr set to initially.

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,010
And we want to subtract from that the length.

34
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:32,840
Let's actually let's console log this.

35
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,610
All right.

36
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,360
So if I type in here, you'll see we get 19, 18, 17.

37
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:50,840
So I actually want to multiply that by two so that we get if I have one character, we get 18, 16,

38
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,010
14, 12, because I want it to go down by two each time.

39
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,180
And then when we get you know, we get start getting here.

40
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,240
We passed zero and we go negative.

41
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:07,670
So what I'm going to do is put this into a variable.

42
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,670
We'll call this blurr value.

43
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:20,720
And then we'll take the background and we want to edit the filter properties to the assess filter properties,

44
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,220
so we'll say style dot filter and we're going to set that to let's use a template literal here.

45
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:31,090
So use tactics and set it to blur.

46
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,970
So what we're doing is just essentially setting this value right here, the filter and the blur.

47
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,240
And instead of 20 pixels, we're going to use whatever the blur value is.

48
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,790
So we'll pass in blur value and then be sure to just add pixels after that.

49
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,930
All right.

50
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,970
So now we go back here.

51
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,860
I'm going to close that up and I start to type.

52
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,740
So I'll just type something and you can see it got a little less blurry.

53
00:03:54,250 --> 00:04:06,680
So it should be at, what, 18 now and 16, 14, 12, 10, eight, six, four, two and zero.

54
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,830
So now anything negative obviously will still it'll be a clear image.

55
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:17,870
OK, now this is this is a really good project for you to to expand upon.

56
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,000
Right now, it's it's just testing the length of the password.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,920
But you could test for things like special characters and numbers and all that, and you could use like

58
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,020
regular expressions.

59
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:33,310
There's there's a whole load of things that you could do.

60
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,420
But I think it's a good project to to add on to.

61
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,480
But that's all we're going to do for now.

62
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,170
So I will see you in the next one.
