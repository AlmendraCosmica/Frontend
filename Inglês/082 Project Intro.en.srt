00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,920
All right, welcome to your next project.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:05,670
So in this one, we're going to build a vertical slider.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:09,720
Basically, we have an image on the side and we have some text on this side.

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,700
And this could be any kind of content you want.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,250
And then these two arrows here, if I click the up, what's going to happen is one side goes up, one

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:23,070
side goes down, but it brings into place the correct text area and the correct image.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,150
So go up again.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,170
Up again.

9
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,580
So we have four different sides.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,990
If I click up again, it just goes back to the beginning.

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,240
Same with down.

12
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,520
So then it just goes the opposite way, so I think it's a it's a really cool looking slider.

13
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:41,200
It's not really responsive if we make this smaller, you can see it doesn't really look good on smaller

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,420
screens just because of the orientation of it.

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,530
But that's not really the point here.

16
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,260
This is this is made for, you know, a desktop, laptop, et cetera.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:54,820
If you wanted to, you could go on and try to maybe switch the orientation on smaller screens.

18
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,730
But we're going to go ahead and build this out.

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,690
I think it's a really cool looking project.

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,220
So let's get started.
