1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,120
So in this project, we're going to build a little application that shows you the key code and the code

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,900
for any key on your keyboard.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:13,350
So if I come to the page here, it says Press any key to get the key code, I'm going to hit Al and

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:20,340
it'll show me the actual key, which is L the key code, which is 76 and the code, which is key L if

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,150
I hit A by one, we get 49 digit one.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,720
If I hit tab, we get tab nine is the key code.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,200
So I mean this is going to be really simple, but it can be useful if you need to get the code for something.

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:42,420
I just want to show you if I search for JavaScript key codes, the first result here is, is the application

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,750
that this is based off of.

10
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:51,090
If I hit a key, gives me the code key code also gives you the the which property which is deprecated.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,430
And I also want to mention that key code.

12
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,580
So this one right here is actually deprecated.

13
00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:05,640
So if we look at the Murdochs, you'll see that this is deprecated and it's recommended to use DOT code,

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,960
which we're also showing.

15
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:13,110
And it says, you know, this property is useful when you want to handle keys based on their physical

16
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,810
positions on an input device rather than the characters associated with those keys common in games and

17
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,620
stuff like that.

18
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,450
All right.

19
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,030
So, I mean, this key code does still work.

20
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,960
If it doesn't, you know, if you're watching this in the future, then you can just simply get rid

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,790
of this box and just display the code.

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,220
But we're going to go ahead and get started.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,780
So let's get into it.
