1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,480
OK, so now we want to start to deal with the hover effects we want when we hover on this side on the

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,740
left, it's going to spread out.

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,540
It's going to the width will be wider.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,090
Same thing if we hover over here.

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,830
So I'm going to manually just add on the on the container, the div with the class of container, I'm

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:22,070
going to add hover left and save that just so we can style it and see what we're doing.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:31,140
So let's say for the class of hover dash left when that one when that's active then we want to take

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,610
the left side and we want to increase the width and this is going to be in a custom property or a variable

9
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,340
called hover dash width.

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,510
Now at the same time, when when Hover Left is active, the right side is going to be smaller.

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:54,660
So we then want to set that with to a variable called other with.

12
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:56,880
All right.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,690
And then we'll go up here and we'll set those variables.

14
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,690
When I say variables are custom properties, I mean the same thing.

15
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,650
So dash, dash, hover, dash width is going to be seventy five percent and you can change this ratio

16
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:11,280
if you want.

17
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,870
So other with is going to be twenty five percent.

18
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,920
Now if I save that hover left is applied to this, to the container.

19
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,070
So the left side is now wider and 75 percent.

20
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,520
The other side is 25, which is what we want now.

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:39,300
At the same time, let's copy these two lines and say if hover right is applied, then we want the right

22
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,120
side to be over with.

23
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:49,200
And then down here, if hover right is applied, we want the left side to be the other with.

24
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:54,570
So now if I go when I apply here, I have a right and save.

25
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,030
Now this side is wider.

26
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,840
So that's exactly what we want.

27
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,540
Now I am going to add the JavaScript now so that this gets added dynamically instead of us having to

28
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,660
actually put it in here.

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,390
So now it's going to go back to normal.

30
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,130
And if we go into our JavaScript here, let's bring in the left side.

31
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,240
So conse left.

32
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:22,350
I'm going to use document dot query selector and we want to select the class of left.

33
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,030
Copy that down.

34
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,980
We also want to grab the right side.

35
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,070
So that'll be right.

36
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,740
And then we also want to grab the container because that's where we're adding the classes to and removing

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,780
the classes from.

38
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:42,960
So container and then we'll take the left, we'll add an event listener with ADD event listener and

39
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,470
this time we're listening on a mouse enter event, which is basically a hover.

40
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,020
And then when that happens, we're going to call an arrow function and take the container.

41
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,720
I don't need to put curly braces, since this is just one line in this function.

42
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:05,910
I'm going to take the container and I'm going to call class list dot add to add a class and I'm going

43
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,850
to add the class of hover dash left.

44
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:14,620
So I'm just dynamically doing what I just manually did in the in the, in the HTML.

45
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,050
All right.

46
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:22,110
Now if I save this and I go and I hover over it, you can see that it gets wider and just stays there.

47
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:24,740
So we need to take care of removing it as well.

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,950
So say left out event listener in this time it's going to be mouse leave, right.

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,580
So mouse leave and then we want to remove the hover left.

50
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:43,440
So now you can see that I can go in, gets wider, I move, it gets thinner and we want to do the same

51
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,070
for the right.

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:53,430
So I'm just going to copy that and we will take, let's say this, this and this and this and change

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,030
it all to.

54
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,590
Right.

55
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,940
OK, so when we add we mouse enter the right, it's going to add however right.

56
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,650
When we leave it's going to remove Huba.

57
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:01,960
Right.

58
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,230
So now I can go on either side.

59
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,560
Now it's just flicking back and forth which I don't like.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,410
So we just want to add a smooth transition.

61
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,340
So we just need to take let's take a split.

62
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,820
Right.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,320
I'm going to go right here and say split right, split.

64
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,730
Dasch left.

65
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,980
And let's also grab the pseudo selectors to split up.

66
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,260
Split right.

67
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,470
Kalanchoe and before and split it left.

68
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:46,140
Colon, colon before and we're just going to add a transition, so transition on all and the speed is

69
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:54,200
going to be inside of a variable called speed and we'll do an easing out effect.

70
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,270
So let's go up here and apply a speed variable.

71
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,370
That way you can just change it here if you want.

72
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:09,270
So speed is going to be 1000 times or 1000 milliseconds, which is one second and now.

73
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,260
OK, it looks like the overlay.

74
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,990
Let's see what they mess up down here.

75
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,880
So transition.

76
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,950
So I've split.

77
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,280
A split dash left should be split, Ditlev, so the overlay was working, but the actual left wasn't.

78
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,570
So now you can see that it's working.

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,440
So it looks pretty good.

80
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:40,630
The last thing I want to do is on smaller screens, like under 800.

81
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,000
I want to just make the H1 smaller and the buttons smaller.

82
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,860
So let's add a media query here.

83
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:59,870
So we'll say media, let's say Max with 800 pixels, then let's take the H1 and let's set the font size

84
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,390
to set it to two ram.

85
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,750
So from forum to two ram and then for the button.

86
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:14,240
So BTN let's set the width to twelve ram.

87
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,620
I think it was 15 to begin with and we'll also lessen the padding.

88
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,070
So padding will do one point two ram

89
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,520
and let's see.

90
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:28,700
So these are kind of far away so.

91
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,630
I guess we can move the H1 down a bit, so from the top, I believe it was 20 percent, let's do 30

92
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,370
percent and that will move it down.

93
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,330
All right.

94
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,940
So I think that looks pretty good, even on smaller screens.

95
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,230
So that's when we hit 800 pixels.

96
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,990
So that's going to be it.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,760
And if you guys want to change up the content, obviously, I just thought this was a good idea because

98
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,020
of the time of year.

99
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,910
And, you know, the systems are coming out.

100
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,810
They're really popular.

101
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,740
I, I have yet to find find a PlayStation five myself.

102
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,170
So I just thought it'd be a good idea.

103
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,090
But of course, you can change the content up.

104
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:06,900
All right.

105
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,310
That's it.

106
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,190
Thanks for watching.

107
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,190
Hopefully you enjoyed this project and I will see you in the next one.
