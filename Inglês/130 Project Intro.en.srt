1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,080
All right, so now we're going to create this 3-D box's project and we're going to be using some modern

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,850
access to create this 3-D effect where we have this angle here and here and we connect the right in

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,000
the bottom side and it just gives us a 3-D box look.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:20,910
And then we're going to be using a background image or a background gif for each of these boxes.

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,720
And it's all the same image.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,880
It's this minyon image.

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:31,440
And what we're going to do is extend the background size beyond the single box to make it as big as

8
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,690
this container here.

9
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,640
And then what we'll do is dynamically calculate the background position so we can move these around

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,220
and basically form what looks like one big image when really this is just a bunch of the same image.

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,770
We're also going to add an event listener onto this button here.

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,860
So when we click this, this whole area shrinks and it also gives us this rotate effect on each box

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,900
and then it combines them all together.

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,520
So there's no spacing in between.

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,380
And it just looks like one big connected image.

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,280
All right.

17
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:07,140
So we'll be using things like CSFs transforms and transitions.

18
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,320
We'll use the after and before pseudo selectors.

19
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,190
We're going to be using a loop and JavaScript to go through these boxes and calculate the background

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:24,090
position and also add an event listener onto this with some success transitions to give it that rotation

21
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:24,540
effect.

22
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,200
All right.

23
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,070
So that's what be doing.

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:27,330
Let's go ahead and get started.
