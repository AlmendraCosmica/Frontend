1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,340
All right, in the last video, we went ahead and created most of the styling, we have our background

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,150
gradient, we have our little nav bar here.

3
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:12,320
And now we want to do the icon, which is a button with the class of icon.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:21,510
So let's go ahead and do that or add an icon and we're going to set the background color to whites,

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,570
which is the same as it's as it's a container there.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,360
And then we want to get rid of that border as well.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,190
So we'll set that border at zero.

8
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:37,350
So now we essentially can't see anything and then we're going to set the cursor to a pointer so that

9
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,600
when we hover over it, we get that cursor.

10
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,420
We want to set any padding to zero.

11
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:52,020
We're going to position this relative because the lines inside are going to be positioned absolute and

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,200
we're going to set the height and the width both to 30 pixels.

13
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,340
All right.

14
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,840
We can't see anything just yet.

15
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,970
One thing that I want to get rid of is this outline on the focus state.

16
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:12,690
So we'll say icon Cole and focus, and we want to set the outline to zero.

17
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,250
OK, now we want to style the lines.

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,080
Remember this to Divs inside the button with the class of line.

19
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,410
So we want to style that.

20
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:34,970
So let's say icon line and we'll set the background color and we'll set that to hexadecimal five to

21
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:38,570
nine zero F nine.

22
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,160
And we want to set the height.

23
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,110
So the gist is going to be two lines or set two pixels to the height.

24
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,750
So we have two two pixel lines.

25
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,000
Now we want to position this to be absolute.

26
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,420
And actually it's put our width as well.

27
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,110
So the width is going to be 20 pixels and we position absolute.

28
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:12,150
Now, we want to move this from, let's say, from the top 10 pixels and from the left five pixels.

29
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:14,160
So this is the top line.

30
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:19,130
Now, both of them are in the same exact spot right now because they both have the line, the class

31
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,940
of line, which we just put in the same position.

32
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:29,300
So what we're going to do is right underneath, let's say, icon, and then we want to take line two

33
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:36,320
and we want to move it down so we can actually use auto for the top and from the let's say from the

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,230
bottom 10 pixels.

35
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:46,370
OK, so now we have two separate lines now up here, see what else do we want?

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,680
And we want to add a transition, actual weight.

37
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,270
What do the transition after?

38
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,690
Let's do the rotate.

39
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:58,430
So remember, when we click it, when it goes from an X to the two lines, we want them to rotate.

40
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,170
So we're going to go down here and they need to rotate in different directions.

41
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:11,480
So we want to say NAV and when it's active, we want to take icon and we want line one first.

42
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:18,650
So let's take line one and let's add a transform so that we can rotate.

43
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:27,350
And the degrees is we're going to do a negative seven sixty five degree rotation.

44
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:36,920
And we also need to add translate y for the positioning and that's going to be 5.5 pixels.

45
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,200
All right.

46
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,000
And then what I'll do is just copy this whole thing.

47
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,590
And this is going to be for line two and this is going to be positive, seven, six, five degrees.

48
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,230
And then this will be negative because we want them to go in a different way.

49
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,730
So save that and now we have an X now when they when it changes, we need to have a transition.

50
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:11,070
So let's go back up to here to the line class and let's add a transition.

51
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:15,120
We want to put it on the transform property.

52
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,000
Everything is zero point six seconds.

53
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:26,070
Of course, you can change that if you like linear and you can see when I save and that's applied,

54
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,770
you can see the rotation.

55
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,860
So the last thing we have to do now is the JavaScript, which is very, very it's only, I think like

56
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,480
five, five, six lines.

57
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,550
Basically, we just need an event listener on this button so that when we click at the active class

58
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:42,420
is toggled.

59
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,900
So let's go to our script and let's say const toggle and set that to document it.

60
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,360
And we're going to use get element by D to pull in the idea of toggle, which is the button.

61
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,840
Right.

62
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,570
So we have this idea of toggle, so we're grabbing that.

63
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,470
We also want to grab the nav by this side.

64
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:14,400
So let's say const nav document gets element by D and we want the NAV back and then what we're going

65
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,780
to do is take the toggle and we're going to add an event listener on to it because we want to listen

66
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,620
for a click.

67
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,830
So pass and click.

68
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:29,550
And then we have a function which you can write out like this, or you can use an arrow function, which

69
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,990
is what I prefer, so we can get rid of that and then just add an arrow, OK?

70
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,450
And then we're going to take the nav and we're simply going to toggle the active class, meaning that

71
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,160
if it's applied, it'll remove it.

72
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,480
If it's not applied, it will add it.

73
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,600
So let's take a class list and class list.

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,610
You can do add if you want to add a class, you can do remove to remove one or you can do toggle, which

75
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,720
is what we want and we want to toggle the active class.

76
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,160
All right.

77
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:05,220
Now, with arrow functions, if we only have one single line like this in the function body, we don't

78
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,560
even need these curly braces.

79
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,570
We can just do that.

80
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,260
I mean, you don't have to, but I don't know.

81
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,020
So it's shorter.

82
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,650
It's cleaner.

83
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,410
So let's try this out.

84
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,310
I'm going to go over here and I'm going to click this.

85
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,160
And there we go.

86
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:29,820
So all the transitions are applied, including the rotation of of the icon, the rotation of the rotation

87
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,680
and the capacity of the links.

88
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,640
You can see they spin and they fade in and out the width of the the container here.

89
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,400
So all these transitions are applied when that class is added and removed.

90
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,660
All right.

91
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,270
So that's pretty much a pretty simple project.

92
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:55,380
You could integrate this into your website or your app, your mobile app, whatever it is that that

93
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,490
you want to use it with.

94
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,200
But that's it.

95
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,670
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next project.
