1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,990
OK, so let's get started with the HTML and success.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,180
So basically what we're going to do first is just create the three boxes.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,840
We're just going to put it directly in the HTML later on.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,070
That'll be replaced with JavaScript, because when we come to the page, we only want to see that one

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:17,520
box.

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,680
And then as soon as we hit a key, we'll see the three with the three values, the key, the key code

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,310
and the code.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:36,180
So let's start here by just changing the title here to say, you know, just say event codes and then

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:41,390
we're going to have a wrapper div here with the idea of inserts.

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,860
And in here we're going to have some classes, some divs with the class of QI, which is basically just

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,710
the box, the border, the background color and so on.

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,600
So this will be let's just say it's the a key that we hit.

13
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,940
This will be dynamic later on.

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,560
We'll add this with the JavaScript.

15
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:03,240
But for now, I'm just going to hard code the letter A and have a small tag here.

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:12,510
And we'll just give this a label of event key, because that's what it is on the event object, it's

17
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,190
going to be the key value.

18
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:17,630
And then under that, d'Hiv will have another class of key.

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,200
And this is going to be the key code, which for A is 65.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,910
So I'm just going to hard code that in there.

21
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:31,220
And let's say this is the event dot key code and then we'll have another class of key.

22
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,190
And this is going to be the code, which in this case would be Keet.

23
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:45,330
And inside small tags here will say event dot code and then we'll have one final div with the class

24
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:45,890
of key.

25
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,870
And this is just going to be like the welcome box.

26
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:59,850
It'll say press any key to get the key code and code will just say to get the key code.

27
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:02,450
All right.

28
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,320
So that should be it for the HTML.

29
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,040
Pretty simple.

30
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,790
Let's jump into the stylesheet and the styling is not going to be too bad either.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,270
I just want to use a different font.

32
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,860
So I'm going to say success.

33
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:24,060
Questionmark family and let's put that to Ammu Ally and set that on the body here and move.

34
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,360
I change the font also on the body.

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:38,910
I'm going to add a background color of one three times and let's set we can get rid of the Flex Direction

36
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,480
column.

37
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,890
And I just want to add a text aligned center here.

38
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:53,240
So text align center and then all we really need to style is the key class and then the small tags inside.

39
00:02:53,250 --> 00:03:01,890
So for key, let's give this a border so the border will be one pixel solid and it'll be hexadecimal

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,970
999.

41
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,430
And then I'm going to give it a slightly lighter background color of Tripoli.

42
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,590
And then let's add a box shadow, just a very slight shadow.

43
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:21,510
I'm going to do one one pixel for both the horizontal and vertical offset and three pixels for the blur

44
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:27,990
and then for the color of RGB, a black zero zero zero for red, green, blue and zero point one for

45
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,400
alpha.

46
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,030
So just a very slight shadow on the right and bottom.

47
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:40,950
So let's set I'm going to set the display actually to an inline flex.

48
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:52,050
OK, so they're going to be side by side and then let's set a line items to center and let's set the

49
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,480
font size to be bigger.

50
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,950
I'm going to set that to twenty pixels and lots of the padding of this of each one to twenty pixels.

51
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:14,130
And let's set the I'm actually going to set the flex direction to column and then let's set the margin

52
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,570
will break apart a little bit.

53
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,440
So let's do ten pixels margin

54
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,270
and let's see what else do we want to do here.

55
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,370
Let's set the font weight to Bould.

56
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,810
So I'll go right here and say font weights set that to bold.

57
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,310
What else do we want to do here is that the correct font doesn't look like it?

58
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:39,190
No, it's not.

59
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:42,150
So right here we should have an ampersand.

60
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:43,740
There we go.

61
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,390
And then let's set Menwith here for each box as well to 150.

62
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:59,010
All right, so now we'll do the small tags, actually, one more thing I want to do is position this

63
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:05,150
relative because the small tags inside of the key class are going to be positioned absolute.

64
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,340
So when you position something absolute and access, if you want to position it inside this container,

65
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,610
then you would make that position relative.

66
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:23,740
So let's take the key class and small tags inside of it and let's position that absolute.

67
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:28,230
As soon as I do that, it's going to, you know, it's going to get put here, but I actually want to

68
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,400
move it up here.

69
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:33,930
So let's set the top value to a negative.

70
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,500
So negative.

71
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,520
Twenty five, twenty four pixels because I want to bring it out of that box and I'll put the left value

72
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,450
to zero.

73
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,640
But I do want it in the middle.

74
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:51,190
So I'm going to set text a line to center and also set the width to 100 percent.

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,690
That, that'll put it in the middle let's add or let's change the color to five, five, five.

76
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,020
And I want it smaller.

77
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:07,310
So let's set the font size to 14 pixels dots and I think we should be good.

78
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:07,640
Yeah.

79
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,140
So that looks OK.

80
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,890
So in the next video, we want to give this some functionality where we don't even show these three

81
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,110
boxes until we actually hit a key.

82
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:21,120
And then obviously whatever key we hit, this data in here is going to be different.
