1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,710
OK, so now we're going to start on the JavaScript to get this to function and slide.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,270
So in our script, yes, I'm going to go ahead and bring everything that we need in.

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:17,580
So let's bring in our slider container and we're going to use document, dot, query, selector and

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,420
select by the class of slider dash container.

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,880
And then we're going to bring in a couple other things.

6
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,570
So this is going to be the right slide.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,410
So class of right Dasch slide.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,900
And for the variable here, we'll call this slide.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,550
Right.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:48,870
And then we're also going to have slide left and that's going to have that has the class of left to

11
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:49,890
slide.

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,090
All right.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,430
Then we also want the buttons.

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:03,000
So we have the up button up dash button and we have the down dash button.

15
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,570
And let's call this one up button.

16
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:20,140
Down button, and then I also want to get the length of the slides, meaning how many slides do we have?

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:29,350
So let's say slides length and we'll set this to query selecter, all because what we're selecting is

18
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:30,880
all the divs.

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,190
And we actually don't want all the divs in the document.

20
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,650
We want all the divs that are in the slide.

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,750
Right.

22
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,350
OK, so basically all those divs with the background images.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,550
So in here we want to query selector all the dishes that will give us all the elements, but we just

24
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,480
need the length.

25
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:53,140
So we'll use the length property here and that will give us it will give us four in this case if I can.

26
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:59,290
So log slides length and me go over here and open this up.

27
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,820
You can see that we get four.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,070
OK, so you'll be able to add more or less slides if you want.

29
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:13,150
Now we want to have an active slide index because basically these are positioned to be like on top of

30
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,600
each other.

31
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,410
We need to know which index is basically in view.

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,200
So let's say active slide index.

33
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,890
Make sure use let here and we'll set that to zero to start with.

34
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,000
And let's take the slide left, OK?

35
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:38,560
And then we're going to add a style and we want to apply the top and set that to a set of tactics.

36
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:45,490
And we want to do negative because this is actually going to go up and the initial top value is going

37
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:51,370
to be negative and then put in our our expression syntax here and then some parentheses.

38
00:02:51,370 --> 00:03:00,490
And we want to take the slide length and subtract by one because the length is going to be for.

39
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:07,630
However, the index is zero based, so the index will be like zero one to three, even though this four

40
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:09,400
total, it starts at zero.

41
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,520
So we want to get the last index, which in this case would be three, which would be the fourth slide,

42
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:19,900
OK, because arrays are no lists, they're zero based.

43
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:28,900
And then we want to multiply that by 100 because it takes up one hundred percent or 100 viewport heights.

44
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,670
So let's add here, vich.

45
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,600
All right.

46
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,240
Now, if I save that and I go back, I noticed that this has moved to the correct position.

47
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:40,950
So Flying Eagle actually goes with this image here.

48
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,810
Now we just want to add functionality so we can, you know, flick these up and down.

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,620
One side will go up, one side will go down, and it should bring the correct slides into place.

50
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:00,220
So let's take the up button and let's call an add an event listener for a click.

51
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,570
And when that happens, we're going to run.

52
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:14,920
We'll call this function change slide and we will pass in an argument of OP, OK, and then I'm going

53
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,630
to copy this down and then this one is going to call down and this is going to be on the down button.

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,670
So let's change this here to down button.

55
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,680
So they're both going to call the same function.

56
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,810
They're just going to get passed in a different argument.

57
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,400
So let's create our function.

58
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,330
We'll use an arrow.

59
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,450
So we'll say change slide equals and it's going to take in a direction as a parameter.

60
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,790
And then let's get the slider height.

61
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:49,180
So we'll say conse slider height, and that's going to be the slider container.

62
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:55,600
And then there's a property called client height, OK, which will give us just that.

63
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,010
In fact, we can console log so you can see what that gives us slider height.

64
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,410
And if I go over here and I click the button we get six, six, six.

65
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,520
Is that a bad sign.

66
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,770
Let's click up again.

67
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,880
Five seven seven.

68
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,420
So it's based on whatever, you know, whatever the height is here and it's it's going to be completely

69
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:19,960
dynamic.

70
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,590
Doesn't matter how, you know, high or small it is.

71
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,830
So that will give us the slope, whatever the slider height is.

72
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,470
Now, let's check for the direction that's being passed in.

73
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:41,230
If the direction is, let's say, equal to up, then what we're going to want to do is take the active

74
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,040
index, active slide index and increment that by one.

75
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,690
So plus plus and then we want to know what happens if we hit the end.

76
00:05:49,690 --> 00:06:02,110
So let's say if the active slide index happens to be greater than the last the last index in the slide,

77
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,170
which we can get with slide length oops, slide slide length.

78
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,810
But we want to take away one.

79
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:18,630
From that, so if that's true, then we'll set the active slide index to zero to back to the beginning.

80
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,510
So basically, if we get to the end, we're going to go back to the beginning.

81
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:22,950
All right.

82
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:31,360
Now, if I click on up, you can see nothing is happening yet because we need to add a transform.

83
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,420
We need to translate it on the Y axis, basically move it up and down.

84
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:46,320
So down here, after the if I'm going to take the slide, we're going to have to move both slide left

85
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,370
and slide right.

86
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,360
So let's take the right slide right.

87
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:00,870
And set the style dot transform and we want to translate the Y on the Y axis.

88
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:03,360
So translate why.

89
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:12,690
And what we want to pass in here is negative because we want the right side to go up and then our expression

90
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:20,250
syntax, we want the active slide index multiplied, whatever the slider height is, because remember

91
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:24,810
the slider height is variable and then we just want to add pixels on to it.

92
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,270
So if I save that, I go over here and I click up.

93
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,520
Nothing happens.

94
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,630
Let's see, slide length is not defined.

95
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,190
Slide length is not defined.

96
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,130
Oh, it slides length, plural.

97
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,430
All right, so let's try that and then we go so you can see that it switches.

98
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:52,290
Now, if I do it and it's at a certain height and then the height changes, you can see it kind of bleeds

99
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:52,740
over.

100
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,640
If I click it again, it's going to then recalculate the height based on this right here, OK, which

101
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,190
we put in to this variable which we're using down here.

102
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:08,680
Now, I want it to actually have a smooth transition rather than just flicking over.

103
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,080
So let's go back to our style sheet and let's see.

104
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,350
We want to go on both the left and right slides.

105
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,050
So let's go up to the left slide here and let's add a transition.

106
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,950
So we want to transition the transform property, which is what we're changing in our JavaScript.

107
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,810
And we'll do a point five seconds and ease in out.

108
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,210
And then I want to do the same thing for.

109
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,760
Right.

110
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,630
So right here, we'll add that as well.

111
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,530
And let's see what happens here.

112
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:44,870
All right.

113
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,080
So now you can see it has that transition.

114
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,560
And when we get to the end, it just goes back to the beginning.

115
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,580
OK, so now we want the same for this side, because right now we're just switching the images.

116
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,960
This is staying the same.

117
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,660
So let's grab this here and paste that.

118
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:11,660
And then we want to say slide left and change the the transform value translate why?

119
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,470
And we just want to make this positive because we want it to go the other way.

120
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:16,220
Right.

121
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,670
So active slide index times slide or height pixels.

122
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,440
So now if I click up.

123
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,660
There we go.

124
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,610
All right, so it just goes the opposite way now, the down button doesn't do anything.

125
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:35,880
So up here where we have this, if direction is up, let's go right now.

126
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,270
Let's put an elsea.

127
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,350
Actually, let's do an else.

128
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:53,890
If so else, if the direction is equal to down, then we're basically going to do something similar

129
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,760
to what we did here.

130
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,970
So we can copy that, but we want to decrement that.

131
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,800
So minus minus will take away one and we want to check to see if we're at the beginning.

132
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,790
So if this is going to be less than zero, so if that's going to be less than zero, then we're going

133
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:16,120
to set it to the last slide in the index, which is going to be whatever the slides length is, minus

134
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,870
one, because the length for us at least is four.

135
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:22,780
But the last index would be three because it's zero.

136
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,750
One, two, three is the indexes.

137
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,610
So let's save that.

138
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,850
And now if we click down.

139
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:36,740
There you go, and it should always match up with the correct you know, the correct text with the correct

140
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,230
image.

141
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,230
All right, so that's it.

142
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,250
Hopefully you enjoyed this project.

143
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,210
I think it's a pretty cool looking slider.

144
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,500
So that's it.

145
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,120
I'll see you in the next project.
