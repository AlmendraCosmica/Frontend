1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:04,140
All right, so now we're going to add the JavaScript for this project and we're going to do do this

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,110
a little bit different.

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,780
We've had a few projects where we've had to click on something and just change the class to active.

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:15,480
And basically what we've done is kind of loop through the elements and then add an event listener on

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,140
each one.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,760
In this project, we're going to use something called event bubbling to not have to add an event listener

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,190
on each element.

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,830
I mean, it's fine if you do in a case like this where we have three, but what if you have like 200

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,980
a table with 200 users with 200 delete buttons?

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:36,600
You're probably not going to want to add an event listener in every single delete button so you can

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,860
take advantage of event bubbling and event propagation.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,660
So first thing we're going to do is bring in what we need.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:51,540
Let's bring in ratings and ratings is there's those multiple ratings, which are the these three boxes,

14
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,080
basically.

15
00:00:52,090 --> 00:01:00,690
So we want to use query selector all and get the class of rating and that'll give us a node list with

16
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,070
the three these three elements here.

17
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,410
We also want let's just copy this down twice.

18
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:15,120
So we also want the send button and that has an idea of send and we want to just use query selector

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,360
because it's just one element.

20
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,760
Same thing here.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,910
We want to grab the panel, which has an idea of panel like that.

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,210
All right.

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,180
Now, like I said, there's a few ways we could do this.

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,800
We could take the ratings and we could do a foreach.

25
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,810
We could save for each rating.

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,750
We want to take that rating and add an event listener at a click event and so on.

27
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,430
But instead of doing that.

28
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:50,940
We're going to use event bubbling or we're going to take advantage of event bubbling, basically, when

29
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,420
we if we have an event on this button here and I click it, it's going to fire off for the button,

30
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,010
but it's also going to fire off for any of its parents.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,460
So this panel, this box here is a parent of the button.

32
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:13,800
So if I were to take that panel and add an event listener onto it for a click event and then say when

33
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:21,330
the panel is clicked, then let's console log, we'll just console log, click, and I'm going to go

34
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,150
over here and open up my console.

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:29,970
Now, if I click this button, you'll see we get click even though it's not this isn't on the button,

36
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,010
it's not on send button, it's on the panel.

37
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,760
But the panel is a parent of the button.

38
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,410
If we look at elements here and we check out the button, you can see it's inside panel, OK?

39
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:48,630
Now, even if I were to click like one of these images, the smiley faces, that's still going to fire

40
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,700
that off because that's inside the panel.

41
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,250
So I'm clicking here and it's bubbling up to panel.

42
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,480
If I click on this this right here, it's going to work.

43
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:04,080
Now, I also want to show you, if we pass in an event object and then we console log e dot target,

44
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,570
you can call this E or a vent, whatever you want.

45
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,150
But if we look at the target and I click on the button, it shows us the exact element that I click

46
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,390
on.

47
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,600
If I click on this image, shows me the image, if I click on this box, not the image, but just inside

48
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,800
the box, that's a div with the class of rating panel itself.

49
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,290
If I click outside the panel, it's not going to do anything because it stops at the panel.

50
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,710
OK, so anything I click in here, it's going to fire this event off.

51
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:39,300
Now, what I want to do is target the these images because I want to click on these images and then

52
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,030
implement, you know, switching the active class.

53
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:49,290
So I'm going to check here, let's say, if he dot targets.

54
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:56,940
So if I see dot target, that's going to that's going to look at whatever element I click on and we

55
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,930
can look at different different aspects of this element.

56
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,640
I want to look at the class list.

57
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,260
So I'm going to say if e dot target class list, which is the list of classes, but then I can add this

58
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,420
method of contains and I can say, does it contain the class of rating?

59
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,710
If it does, then console log target.

60
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,460
So now if I click on the image notice it's not doing anything because this image does not have a class

61
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,150
of rating.

62
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,450
If I click on the box outside of the image, you know, in this box, but not the image, then it works.

63
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,740
And I don't want to do that.

64
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,880
I want it to be on the image itself, on the smiley face.

65
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:46,230
So what I could do is say if the target if what I click on, if the parent node class list contains

66
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,670
rating, then fire this off.

67
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:55,830
So now if I click on the image, you can see that it works OK, because I'm saying if the parent node

68
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:02,400
classless contains rating, which it does, which we can see right here, the image parent is this and

69
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,600
has a class of rating.

70
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,880
So you can target different elements based on pretty much anything really.

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,350
The IDE, the class, the type of element it is the node name.

72
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,540
There's there's all different, you know, properties that you can use.

73
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:23,970
So I'm just going to use this and I'm going to say, if this is true, then I want to take E dot target

74
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,860
and I want to add the class of active, but not on the target because that's the image.

75
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:36,570
I want to take the parent node and then take a class list, call ad and add active.

76
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:41,340
So now I'm just going to close this up for now.

77
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,270
So now if I go and I click on the image, you'll see now it has the box around it.

78
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,130
It's active.

79
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,310
Click on that.

80
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,640
That's also active.

81
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:51,780
Now, the problem is they're all active, which we don't want.

82
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,990
So we need to remove all the active classes beforehand.

83
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,600
So what we'll do is call a function here, let's say remove active.

84
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,720
And I'm going to go down here and create a function called remove active.

85
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,420
And we've done this before.

86
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:16,860
We could take ratings and do a foreach and, you know, remove all the the the active classes.

87
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:20,220
I'm going to use a for loop, which is probably not something I would do.

88
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,020
But just to switch things up a little bit.

89
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:25,290
So let's say let I equals zero.

90
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:32,620
So I is going to start at zero and the condition is going to be if I is less than the ratings Daudt

91
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,300
length.

92
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,570
And then we also want to increment by one through each iteration.

93
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,820
So ratings is the you know, the these three boxes here.

94
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,590
So we're just going to say if it's if I as.

95
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:51,470
Less than whatever the length is, then let's go ahead and take ratings, which is a no list, which

96
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,520
is similar to an array.

97
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:02,590
So we want whatever the index of I and then class list dot remove and we want to remove the active class.

98
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:03,890
All right.

99
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:09,560
So now if I click on the second one, you'll see it's active and it took it off the first one or what

100
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,160
actually happened is it took it off all of them and then put it on the second one.

101
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,680
I click here, same thing.

102
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:18,560
So now I can switch it to, you know, whatever one I want.

103
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:29,360
Now, I also want to when I click on one of these, I want to save whatever the the rating is neutral

104
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,600
and happy and so on, because I want to put that in when we click send I want to put that in the panel.

105
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:44,750
So I'm going to initialize a very old variable up here called Selected Rating and set it initially to

106
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,020
satisfied, because that's what it's going to be on.

107
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,030
You know, when we reload, we come to the page.

108
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,870
That's what it's on.

109
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:59,120
And then down here, when we click, I'm going to take that selected rating and I'm going to set it

110
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,650
to E Target, which is what I click on, which is the image.

111
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:06,110
And obviously, I don't want to put the image in here.

112
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:14,480
I want this text, which if we look at the elements tab here, the text is in the small tag right below

113
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:14,990
image.

114
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,760
So small is a sibling to image right.

115
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,170
Rating is a parent to image small as a sibling there on the same level.

116
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:30,440
So here we can use dot next element sibling.

117
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:31,240
Right.

118
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,840
So that's going to select the small tag.

119
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,010
That's the next sibling.

120
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,290
And I want the inner HTML.

121
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:40,580
I want the content inside of it and I'm going to put that into this variable.

122
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,410
So now if I console log.

123
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,580
Next.

124
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,470
Not next to only sibling for console log selected rating.

125
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:56,010
And they click on one of these, we get neutral, unhappy, satisfied, good.

126
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,970
I just wanted to store that I'm going to just get rid of this console log.

127
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:05,320
Now, when we send this when we send review, it's not going to actually go anywhere.

128
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,580
It's not submitting a form.

129
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,730
But I just want to change the UI here.

130
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,170
So let's go right here and say send button.

131
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:18,430
We want to add an event listener of click.

132
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:30,910
And let's say when we click, we want to take the panel and we want to change the entire HTML to let's

133
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:38,350
use a template literal here and we want to put in I tag those so we want an icon.

134
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,180
So class is going to be FRSS f a dash heart.

135
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,510
OK, and then under that, let's put a strong

136
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,500
and here we're just going to say thank you.

137
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,060
Under that, I just want to space I'm going to put a line break excuse me, and then strong

138
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:12,940
and in here, I want a safe feedback colon and then my variable syntax so I can put in selected rating.

139
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,190
And then let's just put a paragraph in here.

140
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:30,040
We'll say we'll use your feedback to improve our customer support.

141
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,630
All right.

142
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:38,560
So now if I go over here and I suspect neutral and I click send review, we get the correct, you know,

143
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,960
panel here, feedback, neutral and so on.

144
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:48,130
But we have an error down here type error that says cannot read property class list of null online seven,

145
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,190
which is right here.

146
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,350
So remember how the bubbling works.

147
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:59,190
If I click this, it's going to call you know, it's going to bubble up to panel.

148
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:04,420
So even though I have the event listener on send button, it's also going to call the one on panel.

149
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,990
And in that case, this this doesn't exist anymore because we've changed the whole inner HTML of the

150
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,530
panel.

151
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,180
So to fix this, I want to target this.

152
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,130
You know, I don't want to use panel here.

153
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,570
I want to target it further.

154
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:28,270
So I'll use the ratings container, which wraps these three boxes because the button is not in rating's

155
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,070
container, so it's not going to fire that off if we use it.

156
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:39,460
So here, I'm just going to copy this down and say ratings container and we want to use query selector

157
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,640
because it's just one element.

158
00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:52,510
And then the class of ratings Dasch container and then instead of panel, say, ratings container.

159
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:58,690
So now if I select something and send review, we're not going to get that error because this is not

160
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:04,420
being fired off because it's not a parent of send button, OK?

161
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,270
It's actually sibling.

162
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,430
So we have ratings container and then we have send button.

163
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,570
All right.

164
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:16,510
I hope that makes sense that you can read more about event bubbling, event propagation.

165
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:22,840
And also, if I don't click anything and send, I should still see satisfied because we set that initially

166
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,290
here.

167
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:24,640
All right.

168
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,560
So hopefully you enjoyed this.

169
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,880
Again, this there's so many different ways to do stuff with vanilla JavaScript.

170
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,240
But I just wanted to show you a little bit about event babbling methods or I'm sorry, properties like

171
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,120
Parent Node, Next Element Sibling.

172
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:44,860
This helps you navigate the DOM because you need sometimes you need to get to other elements.

173
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,000
And there's just a ton of different methods to to do that.

174
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,560
So I wanted to introduce some of those.

175
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,280
All right.

176
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:51,680
That's it.

177
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,220
Thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next project.
