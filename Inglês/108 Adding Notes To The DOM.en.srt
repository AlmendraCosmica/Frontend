1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,310
All right, so now we're going to start on the JavaScript and ultimately this is going to come from

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:06,790
the JavaScript.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:13,380
But one thing I want to do is on this div here, I want to add a class of Maine, and this just represents

4
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:20,340
where the text will show when we're not in edit mode because the text area will be hidden when when

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,510
we're not in edit mode.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:25,490
And then when we toggle it with this and we go to edit mode, then the text area will show.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,670
So I'm actually going to just get rid of that hidden class for now and then let's let's grab everything

8
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,990
within this div.

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,500
So I'm just going to cut that and then just delete this because we're going to create this with JavaScript

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:42,540
and then we'll just insert what I just covid.

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,930
So I'll save that and go to my script and let's bring in our add button.

12
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,360
So say add Vitton equals documents dot get element by D.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,530
We want to grab the idea of add then we want to add an event listener.

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,190
So add button dot add event listener.

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,120
Listen for a click and when that happens we'll have an arrow function and then we'll call a function

16
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,970
called add a new note.

17
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,670
And down here let's create that function.

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,760
So add new note which is going to take in an optional text argument which will set to nothing by default.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,950
And then I want to build that that div with the class of notes, it will say const note equals and then

20
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,360
on a document object we'll call create elements and we want to create a div.

21
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,410
And then I want to just add the class of note to that.

22
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,840
So we'll say note class list, not add and add the class of note.

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,390
Then we want to take that note and set the inner HTML equal to a set of tactics.

24
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:01,230
And this is where I'm going to paste in what I copied and we'll just kind of clean this up a little

25
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,530
bit.

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,600
Yes, we'll just move this over, OK, and then down here.

27
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:19,280
So basically if there's text, we want to add the class of hidden on the text area.

28
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,170
So both of these classes where we're going to add a dynamic class.

29
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:30,480
So right here, let's open up our our expression syntax with money sine curly brace inside the class

30
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,020
quotes.

31
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:39,360
And I'm going to say if text then have no class else then have a class of hidden, which is display

32
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,510
none, and then on the text area will do the opposite.

33
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:43,040
Right.

34
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:51,270
So say class and we'll say if there's text then have the class of hidden inside the text area or else

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,590
have no class.

36
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,710
OK, and then to put this into the DOM, we can take our document body, which is just, you know,

37
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:05,100
the the browser body and append child meaning we want to add something in it and we want to add the

38
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,960
note every time we click the button.

39
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:16,120
So now click it, click it again and it adds the notes to the DOM and they're in text area mode by default.

40
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:27,730
Now this right here can we can add something in here, like to put a string and just say hello world.

41
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,990
Now, if I save that and I add a note, notice how I can't click in here because of this right here.

42
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:45,090
We're saying for this div, if there's text, which we did pass in, then have no class here and down

43
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,760
here, if there's text and hide the text area.

44
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,740
OK, so we passed in text.

45
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,450
So it's not a text area.

46
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,790
If we do it without passing anything in it is a text area.

47
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,040
Now we want to make these buttons function as far as in this video will go as far as the dorm.

48
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,180
So like deleting it from the dorm and toggling the hidden on these two.

49
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,090
But we're not going to get into local storage until the next video.

50
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:19,950
But let's inside this add new note before we add it to the dorm, let's bring in from the note, the

51
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,640
edit button.

52
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:31,290
So edit BTN and we can actually take from the note, this current note, we want to query selector and

53
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,330
we want the class of edit.

54
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:34,800
Right.

55
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,210
And then I'm going to copy this down.

56
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,650
We want for these because we also want to get the delete.

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,200
So this is going to be the delete button and then we want to get the main.

58
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:52,890
So that's class of main and then we want the text area.

59
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:59,730
So I'm just going to grab it by text area and we'll call this text uppercase A.

60
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:12,560
Area and then let's add an event onto delete, so will take the delete delete button and add event listener,

61
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,410
want to listen for a click and when we click, we'll call a function.

62
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,510
And for now we're just going to remove it from the dorm.

63
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:25,220
So we'll take that specific note and we'll just call remove, which does just that.

64
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,670
It just takes it away from the dawn.

65
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,060
So if I go on, I add a note, I'll add another one.

66
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:34,190
If I click on the trash icon now, I can delete them, OK, or remove them.

67
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:40,460
Now for edit, what we want to happen is we want to be able to toggle main and text area.

68
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,450
So I'll just just grab that and change this to edit.

69
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:56,780
OK, so when we click on edit, what we're going to want to do here is take main class list and toggle

70
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,120
the hidden class.

71
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,650
OK, we're going to do the same thing for text area.

72
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,770
So text area, make sure you use the uppercase A version.

73
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,390
And now you can see when I when I first click it, we have a text area.

74
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:20,570
If I click edit now I can't now it's now the main is showing the div with the class of main so text

75
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,000
area main type in here.

76
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,530
Can't type in here.

77
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,440
OK, and that's all I wanted to do for now.

78
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:34,190
Now if there is text passed in to the function like

79
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:40,280
Hello World, I want to be able to see that here.

80
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,500
So I'm going to go right, right below where we were.

81
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:53,360
We brought in all this stuff and let's say text area and set the value to text.

82
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,270
Now, I also want to set the main area.

83
00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,880
So I'm going to say main dot in our HTML over text area has a value.

84
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,670
So you don't do text area in HTML.

85
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,750
Main is a div.

86
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:12,500
So I'm going to set the entire HTML to the text, but I want it to be markdown so we can use the marked

87
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,500
library by just simply wrapping this in marked.

88
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,720
So if we save that and if I click add note I already had Hello world in there.

89
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,820
So this is the text now.

90
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:23,960
This is the main version.

91
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:31,640
I can't edit it and then if I click edit it's the same thing now I want to make it so that if I update

92
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:37,000
this like I change that high and then I click that, that shows here as well.

93
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,130
So what we can do is add an event listener on to the text area.

94
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:51,080
So let's say text area dot add event listener and we want to listen for any input on that text area.

95
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:58,220
And when that happens, we're going to run a function with the event object and we want to get the value.

96
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:07,100
We want to get e dot target dot value and I'm going to use D structuring to pull out value from target.

97
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:14,690
So since value is on target, I can use curly braces here and say const value and take that from E target

98
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:24,740
and then I'm going to take main and update the inner HTML to the marked version of that value.

99
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,080
So let's save that.

100
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:34,820
And now if I go here and I change this to high and I click that, you'll see that also says hi because

101
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,460
as I type in the text area, this is going to update.

102
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,690
Now, since we're using the marked library, we should be able to add markdown.

103
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,540
So let's do a heading will say like list.

104
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:53,570
So no sign, I'll be an H1, H2, H3, etc. and then we could do like an order list with hyphens.

105
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,430
I'm not going to go over like all the markdown syntax, but it's pretty easy to learn.

106
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,310
I have a mark down crash course on YouTube and if I click that now, you can see we actually have a

107
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,740
heading and we have our list items.

108
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:11,510
We should probably add some padding to that, I think.

109
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:14,630
Yeah, we added padding to the text area right here.

110
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:21,080
So let's also add to main padding.

111
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,030
Yeah, there we go.

112
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,790
All right, cool.

113
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,970
Now, it just it still says, hello, world, when I delete and I create a new one because that's just

114
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:34,960
coming from here and we don't actually want anything to start with.

115
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,220
Right.

116
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:43,090
And we can you know, we can put something in here and it shows in both text area and main.

117
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,370
But when I reload, the note goes away.

118
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,250
So what we want to work on next, since we have, you know, the functionality that we have so far in

119
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:57,430
terms of the DOM, we want to be able to save these to local storage and in the browser.

120
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:03,010
We want to also fetch them from a local storage and show, you know, each note inside of an actual

121
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:03,320
note.

122
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,720
So we'll get into that next.
