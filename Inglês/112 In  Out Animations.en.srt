1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:05,520
OK, so now we want to start to work on the numbers and that animation, so first thing we're going

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,350
to do is style numbers.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:13,710
So remember, we have the class of numbers and we're going to give the NUM the color of a hexadecimal

4
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:17,730
value of three four nine eight DB.

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:25,470
OK, so we'll give it that blue color and then we want to increase the font size a lot.

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:35,040
So let's do 50 pixels and we're going to position this relative because the span inside that that are

7
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,300
around each number, we want those to be positioned absolute.

8
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,580
So the container should be positioned relative.

9
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:47,610
And we're also going to set the overflow to hidden because we don't want anything to go out of the container

10
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,070
and we want to set a width and height on this.

11
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,830
So we're going to set the width to 250 pixels and we're going to set the height to the same as the font

12
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,690
size, which is 50 pixels.

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,710
All right.

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,970
Now, we only want actually, you know what?

15
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,820
Let's position the numbers first.

16
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,540
We want the number to show right in the middle here.

17
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:16,680
So what we'll do is take the spans that are in the nums and we want to position those to be absolute

18
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,650
within its container, within nums.

19
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:29,160
And then we also want to set the position to let's do from the top 50 percent and from the left, 50

20
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,830
percent.

21
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,060
OK, and then what we'll do is to fix that positioning.

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:46,080
We'll add a translate transform I'm sorry, those backwards transform translate and then negative 50

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,800
percent.

24
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,590
Negative 50 percent.

25
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,800
OK, and now you can see that it's right in the middle.

26
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,930
Now we want to start off with a little bit of a rotation, because you can see that the way these numbers

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,100
come in, they come like that and they they turn they rotate.

28
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,840
So we're we're going to start this off.

29
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,850
So they rotate and we're going to do one hundred and twenty degrees.

30
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,380
So it's going to start off like that.

31
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,680
Now we want to change what's called the transform origin.

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,030
We don't want when this starts off, we don't want it to start here.

33
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,370
We wanted to start here when it rotates up like this.

34
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,040
So let me just show you real quick

35
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,030
transform origin.

36
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,050
So right here you can see it set to center.

37
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:39,110
But what I'm going to do is set it to the bottom center.

38
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,810
So if I do that, you can see that it's positioned differently.

39
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:48,390
It's going to come from from here rather than smack dab in the middle like that.

40
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,160
All right.

41
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,070
So it's just going to move it.

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,900
Now, you could also do like top center.

43
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,890
It could come from that way.

44
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,350
So you can change, you know, how it rotates.

45
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:06,650
So I'm going to go ahead and set the transform origin and let's set it to bottom center.

46
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,990
And as soon as I save that, we're not going to see anything here.

47
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,890
Now, if this 120 degrees are set to zero, then we would be able to see it.

48
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,450
And what I'm going to do is take the class of N because remember, we have this class of end that starts

49
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,020
on the three and have that at zero degrees.

50
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,430
So that that that's in focus right here.

51
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,900
So let's say NUMS and we want to grab the band that has the class of it.

52
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,680
And then let's go ahead and take this line here and just change this to zero degrees.

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,360
And that way we can see whatever number has that class on it.

54
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:52,290
Now, we also want to add our animation to the in class and we're going to call this animation go in.

55
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,970
It will be a duration of zero point five seconds and it'll be for my colon here and then it'll be an

56
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:08,490
let's do he's in out effect, OK, because essentially what we want is it to come from here and go over

57
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,410
like that, like you can see here.

58
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:11,900
All right.

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,450
So each number that's coming in has that go in and then we'll have a go out to go this way and we're

60
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,600
going to use transform, rotate to be able to do that.

61
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,250
So we might as well create the out as well.

62
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,890
I'll just copy this so we'll have a class of out.

63
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,190
And this isn't going to have the starting point here.

64
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,930
So you get rid of that.

65
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,980
We're just going to call an animation called Go Out.

66
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:46,050
So let's create both of these animations, these keyframes, so say keyframes, and this will be the

67
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,450
go in animation.

68
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:52,400
Now we're going to have multiple states here, so let's do zero percent.

69
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:53,850
It's going to be our starting point.

70
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:04,560
Then we'll have a 30 percent and then a 60 percent and then a 100 percent, which is where it will end.

71
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,620
So we just want different levels of rotation in these different states.

72
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,730
So I'm going to copy this line here, the transform, translate and rotate and we're going to start

73
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,990
at 120.

74
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:25,320
And because we're going to be, you know, over here and then at 30 percent, I'm actually going to

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,480
go to negative 20 because I don't want to go right just from 120 to zero, because I want to have this

76
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,810
little bounce effect so you can see how it kind of goes forward.

77
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:43,890
And then back if you want, you can do just one twenty two and then put, you know, down here zero.

78
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,490
That's fine.

79
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,500
But if you want that bouncy effect, we're going to go negative 20 at 30 percent and then we're going

80
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,450
to go to ten degrees at 60 percent, which will give it that effect.

81
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,230
And you could see when I save it, you can see how it works.

82
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,280
If I take out this and do it, it just comes right in.

83
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,540
And it's slower because remember that no matter what, the duration is always going to be zero point

84
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,440
five seconds.

85
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:09,630
All right.

86
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,880
So that's go in.

87
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:13,530
Now we want to create our go out.

88
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,750
So I'm just going to copy this and let's change this to go out.

89
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,540
And we want to start at zero degrees now because remember, we're starting here and we're going out.

90
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:29,340
So start at zero degrees and then we don't need a 30 percent, but it's 60.

91
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,310
I want to go to 20 degrees.

92
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:41,550
And then at 100, I want to go to negative 120, which is obviously the opposite of 120.

93
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,710
So negative 120 will be over here.

94
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,250
All right, so that should do it, the last thing I want to do is just style.

95
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,590
This age for sprog should have done that earlier.

96
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,450
I'm going to put that up here somewhere.

97
00:06:53,960 --> 00:07:07,040
Just say age four, and it's going to set the font size to 20 pixels and margin five pixels and let's

98
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,940
make it uppercase.

99
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,960
So text transform is going to be upper case.

100
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:12,560
There we go.

101
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,380
OK, so we have our success done.

102
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:22,340
Now we have to do a couple of things in the JavaScript we need to control when we want to show this

103
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,290
and when we want to show our final message.

104
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:34,040
We also need to basically loop through these spans here and add and remove the in and out class so that

105
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,580
we can have that animation happen continuously.

106
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,120
All right.

107
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,520
So we're going to do that in the next video.
