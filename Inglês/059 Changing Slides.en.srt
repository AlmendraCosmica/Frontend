1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:05,100
OK, so now that we have the talent that's done, we want to jump into the JavaScript and we want to

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:12,210
make this function so that when we click the arrow, it slides the background image and also changes

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:12,790
this image.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:15,000
So let's first bring in everything we need.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:20,190
We want the body itself, which we can get from the document object and then body.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,140
And let's grab the slides.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,430
Now, Slide's is more than one of the slide classes.

8
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,130
We have five divs with the class of slides.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:35,400
So we're going to use document dot, query selector all because there's multiple.

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,510
So we want all with the class of slide and then we want the right and left buttons.

11
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,270
So there's a const left vts and set that to document.

12
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:57,030
Dot will use get element by D because we have an I.D. of left and then we also want the idea of right

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,760
and we'll call this one right button.

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:08,010
And then I'm going to initialize a variable here called Active Slide so we know which one we're on.

15
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:19,290
It's going to start at zero and then we'll have a function say function and we'll call this set B.G.

16
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,730
to body.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,760
So this is going to set the background to the body.

18
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,620
And I'm actually going to go in the style access and get rid of on the body here.

19
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,980
Remember, I put I hardcoded the background image.

20
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,060
I'm going to get rid of that.

21
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,370
So we don't see that there anymore.

22
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:45,310
And we want to, in this function, take the body and add a style of background image.

23
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,270
So when we deal with access through JavaScript, it's going to be Camil case like this.

24
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,900
You're not going to use dashes or hyphens, whatever.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,870
So set the background image to and we're going to have our slides now.

26
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:07,740
Slides is when you use this query selector, all this is going to be what's called a node list.

27
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:14,130
So it's similar to an array and we can say, you know, slide zero for the first one, one for the second

28
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,850
and so on.

29
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,620
We're going to put the active slide in here, which starts at zero.

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:27,300
And then we want to do dot style dot background image because that's what we want to get.

31
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:36,540
So we're getting we look at our HTML, we're getting the first slide, which is this div here, right

32
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:36,960
here.

33
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,300
And we're getting the background image, you URL, which is going to be this, and we're going to set

34
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,520
that to the body.

35
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,300
Now we want to call this.

36
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,920
So I'm just going to go right above this and say set B.G. to body.

37
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:55,500
And if I go ahead and save that now you can see we have our background image, our first image.

38
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,420
Now we want to be able to set the active slide to the next image.

39
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,360
So let's also create a function called set active slide.

40
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,760
And what we'll do is take the slides that we brought in, which remember is a node list and we want

41
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,510
to loop through.

42
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,110
I'm going to use the foreach method here and see for each slide and this is going to take an arrow function.

43
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,710
So for each slide, I'm going to take that slide and remove the class.

44
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:38,010
So if we do classless dot remove, we can remove a specific class and that's going to be active.

45
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,530
OK, so we're going to remove that.

46
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,340
And since we used an arrow function, we don't even need these curly braces.

47
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,300
We can just do that.

48
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:52,010
And then after that, for each, I'm going to take slides again.

49
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,110
That's the no list and take the active slide.

50
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,800
And I want to add the class of of active to that.

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,270
So class list.

52
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:11,870
Don't add and add the class of active now if I go up to the top here and I change the active slide to

53
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,660
one, it's going to have the background image.

54
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,490
The second one is the background image.

55
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,570
Change it to two.

56
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,450
It'll be the third one because remember, it's it's a no list, which is basically like an array.

57
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,800
So it's zero based.

58
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,270
And that's being changed down here.

59
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,570
We're setting the background image to whatever that active slide is.

60
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,410
So zero and then it's one to zero.

61
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:37,670
One, two, three, four.

62
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,980
Now, for the front image, we just need to change the class of active to whichever one we want to display.

63
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,760
So if I manually come down here and put it on the second one, that's going to show.

64
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:57,400
So what we'll do is add event listeners onto these arrows so that we can increment this active slide.

65
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:06,200
So let's go right here and let's take the right button and let's add an event listener and we want to

66
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,490
listen for click.

67
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:12,080
And once we do that, we're going to run a function using an arrow function.

68
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,720
So on the right button, we want to take the active slide in increment by one.

69
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:28,100
So we'll just do plus plus now we want to check for the end so we can say if the active slide is greater

70
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:34,040
than the slides at length, which will give us the total length of the node list, but we want to just

71
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,420
take one off of that.

72
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,050
And if that's true, then we want to set it back to zero.

73
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,580
So we'll set active slide equal to zero.

74
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,850
Now, once we set the active slide, we just want to call the two functions down below.

75
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,510
So the first one is going to be set, BGU to body, because that will set the background and then we

76
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:57,670
want to set the active slide.

77
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,850
All right.

78
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,870
So we'll save that.

79
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,400
And now if I come over and I click on this, you'll see that it'll go to the next image.

80
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,570
It changes the background, which also has that transition on it.

81
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,790
Remember, we added that transition to the body.

82
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:17,450
So you have that kind of stat, that effect there, that slide effect, or it's more like a stretch

83
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,230
kind of effect.

84
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,920
And if we get to the last one, it just starts over.

85
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:32,460
OK, so we have, let's see, first image, second, third, fourth, fifth, and then it starts over

86
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,140
so that functionality is done.

87
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:39,330
Now we're going to do essentially the same thing with the left button just in the opposite direction.

88
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,420
So I'm going to copy everything from the right button listener.

89
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,200
And let's set this to the left button.

90
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,010
And on Click, we want to decrement the slide.

91
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,010
So minus minus it's going to take, you know, take away one.

92
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,880
And we want to check for the beginning so we can simply check and see if active slide, if it's going

93
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,690
to be greater than, I'm sorry, less than zero.

94
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:10,710
Then we want to set the active slide to the end to the last one, which is going to be slides, dot

95
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,910
length, slides, dot length and then just minus one off of that.

96
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,260
OK, and then again, just call set background to body and set active slides.

97
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:29,370
Now I can go forward and go backwards and if I'm on the first one and I go backwards, it takes me right

98
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,330
to the last one.

99
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:33,380
All right, cool.

100
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:42,870
So that gives us a nice little slideshow, obviously, this itself isn't too useful.

101
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,620
I mean, I guess it would be if it's like an image gallery.

102
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:52,670
But I mean, I want you to just kind of understand the whole logic of this, bringing in the all the

103
00:07:52,670 --> 00:08:00,500
slides with Querrey Selecter, all having the background change to whatever the background images for

104
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:08,450
that specific slide and then looping through all the slides, removing the act of class and then adding

105
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:10,610
the act of class onto the next one.

106
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:17,220
OK, which is going to be either, you know, increment or decrement, depending on which arrow we click.

107
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,560
So that's it.

108
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,360
Hopefully guys like this project.

109
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,700
Let's jump into the next one.
