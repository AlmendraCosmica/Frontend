1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,790
All right, so this is just going to be a fun little project where we actually take some checkboxes

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,310
and we style them to look like these little sliders here with these little balls that we can animate

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,580
back and forth.

4
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:18,330
OK, so we're going to add a little bit of success and style them with success and then add some animations

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,460
to give it this effect.

6
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,990
And then finally, we're going to add a little bit of JavaScript logic, because when you have a project,

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,430
you rarely get it to be good, cheap and fast.

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:36,320
So basically, if we choose good cheap and then we click fast, it's going to uncheck cheap sex.

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,560
So we might get it to be good and fast, but then it's not going to be cheap.

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,460
We can do cheap and fast and we can do cheap and good, but we can't do all three because that's very

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,760
rare.

12
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,880
So it's just a little it's just fun to add a little bit of logic to it.

13
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,130
But, you know, you can use these little slider widgets inside of your user interfaces and Web sites.

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,940
So let's go ahead and get started.
