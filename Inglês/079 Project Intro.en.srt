Hey, guys, this project, we're going to create something that's pretty simple, but also something

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,560
that's very useful that you see quite a bit, and that's a sticky nav.

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,160
So we have this over at the top of our little website here.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,240
We're going to create this hero image with an overlay.

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,040
So we're going to style, you know, a little bit of this Web site here.

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,040
But the main point is the Navar that sticks to the top.

7
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,350
And when I scroll down and I hit a certain point, you can see that it does a few things.

8
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,340
It changes its color, it changes the text color and it lessens the padding and makes it smaller.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:36,600
If I go back up to the top, it turns back black and adds that padding.

10
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,610
So we get that nice little effect.

11
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,310
And you see this a lot on different websites.

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,910
So we figured that it would be a nice addition to the course and to the projects.

13
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,740
So let's go ahead and get started.
