1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:07,170
So we're going to get started here in our TML, let's say, for the title Thene Clock and get rid of

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:14,460
the H1 and I'm just going to paste in the the dribble link for what you know, what this project was

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:16,290
inspired from just to give them credit.

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,810
And we're going to have a clock, but we're also going to have a way to toggle the light mode and the

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,500
dark mode.

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,660
So that's going to be a button.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,310
So we'll have a button with the class of toggle.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,390
And in here for now, it's a dark mode.

9
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:38,880
And then underneath that, we'll have our clock dash container and this is going to include the clock

10
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,540
itself.

11
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:44,540
So I'm going to have a class of clock and the clock will have three needles.

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:49,320
So let's say class needle and let's create three of those.

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,560
And then each one will have its have a separate class so we can tell which one is the hour, which one

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,860
is the minute and which one is the second.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,020
OK, and then underneath that we just want to live with Center Point.

16
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:09,480
That's going to be the center of the clock and then outside of the clock div but still within the container

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:16,080
we're going to have a class of time and this is going to come from the JavaScript.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:23,850
But for now I'm just going to hard code twelve o'clock and then we also want the date and the format

19
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:32,520
of this is going to be like Monday, Monday, November, and then the day will be in a span.

20
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,090
So let's say span with a class of circle.

21
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:39,820
And then here I'll just put it to some Monday, November 2nd.

22
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:40,770
All right.

23
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:43,250
So if I save that, that's what this is going to look like.

24
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,170
So let's jump into our stylesheet and I don't know if we'll get the whole all the CIA.

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,910
We should be able to do all the success.

26
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,970
So I'm going to bring in and see.

27
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,040
We're actually going to use a font called Habbo.

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,860
So let's get from here over to success and success.

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,870
Questionmark family and sit there to HCB.

30
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,330
Oh, so it's going to be our main fun.

31
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,710
Let's say Colen three hundred and then we're going to add that down here.

32
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,230
Hebel save.

33
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,020
You could see the font.

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,810
The fun has now changed.

35
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,990
And then let's see for the body here its display flex.

36
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,310
We want to align center.

37
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,490
We can get rid of flex direction.

38
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,090
And know the rest should be OK now as far as the colors go.

39
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,740
I'm actually going to use some custom properties, so I'm going to go up here and let's say on the route

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:57,390
scope, I want to have a primary color of black and then a secondary

41
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,550
color of white.

42
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:12,900
Basically, this is going to be for for regular mode or light mode, I should say, and then if the

43
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:19,260
HTML has a class of dark, because we're actually going to change that within the JavaScript to enable

44
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,890
mode, then let's actually set the primary color, because you can have different scopes for different

45
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,510
variables.

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:34,320
So if it's on this primary dark scope, then the primary color I'm sorry, Teladoc scope and the primary

47
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:42,390
color will be white and the primary colors like the hands of the clock and stuff like that, the text

48
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,270
and then the secondary.

49
00:03:48,020 --> 00:04:00,140
Color will be let's do three, three three, so real dark gray and then we'll say HTML dyed dark and

50
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:11,030
we're going to set the background color here to let's do one one one which is almost black and then

51
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,740
the color.

52
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,200
So the text is going to be the primary color.

53
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:24,440
So var dash dash primary color and it's going to be white because on that scope the primary colors white

54
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,350
everywhere else, the primary color will be black and obviously you don't have to use custom properties.

55
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:36,590
But I figured I'd make it so that we could easily, you know, change these up here rather than going

56
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,920
through and changing each one later on.

57
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:47,390
So when we click Doc Mode and this changes, you know, the background goes dark and everything else

58
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:53,300
goes white, I want it to have a transition so that it kind of has a fading effect rather than just,

59
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,880
you know, flicking to a different color.

60
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:06,500
So I'm going to add scoresheet here on HTML on the H2O element, let's transition, say transition all

61
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,340
zero point five seconds with an ease in effect.

62
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:14,900
OK, so that way when the background color changes, it'll fade in.

63
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:21,560
Now for the let's start on the the stuff in here for the toggle.

64
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:32,900
So the toggle button, let's do background color and we're going to set that to a cost to our one of

65
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:38,300
our custom properties of primary color, which is going to be black by default.

66
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:43,820
And then let's set the color to the secondary color.

67
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:55,950
OK, so of secondary color and let's get rid of the border, let's set a border radius of four pixels,

68
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:05,590
let's set the padding to eight pixels, top and bottom, 12 pixels left and right.

69
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:17,120
And what else, let's position this, so I'm going to position this to be absolute and I want it up

70
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,910
at the top, so let's say one hundred pixels down from the top.

71
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,810
And then this has this outline when it's when we focus on it.

72
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:31,700
So let's say toggle when it's in its focus state, we want to set the outline to none.

73
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:38,980
OK, so now let's start on actually, let's give it a curse, curse or appointers as well.

74
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:50,420
OK, so let's start on the clock container, which wraps around the the needles and wraps around the

75
00:06:51,080 --> 00:07:00,350
the centerpoint, so clock dash container and I'm going to display that as a flex box.

76
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:06,820
And then let's set the flex direction from RO.

77
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:15,390
Let's set it to a column and I'm going to justify the content to this space.

78
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,370
Let's do space between and then line items to center.

79
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:27,110
Now we can't really see much within this container because everything is just an empty div.

80
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,130
So we'll go ahead and start to style the stuff inside.

81
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:38,990
So we do have a clock class that's going to be positioned relative so we can position stuff inside of

82
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:39,100
it.

83
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,850
Absolute.

84
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:45,740
And I'm going to set the width and the height both to two hundred pixels.

85
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,900
OK, and then we're going to do the needles now every needle, hour, minute and second has this needle

86
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:01,620
class and I'm going to give this clock a temporary background color, just a light gray.

87
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,690
I'm not going to keep this here.

88
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,480
It's just so we can see the outline of the clock and we can position the needles.

89
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,780
So we're going to have like a base needle class and we have the the hour, the minute and second needle.

90
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:21,330
But this is the base class and we want the background color of this to be whatever the primary color

91
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:21,720
is.

92
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:28,500
And then we're going to position this absolute within the clock class and the clock classes relative.

93
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,510
So position absolute.

94
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:37,710
And let's put it from the top, let's say 50 percent and from the left.

95
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,590
Fifty percent and let's give it an initial height of sixty five pixels, obviously each needle, you

96
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:52,720
know, the hour is going to be shorter than the minute, but will make the the the hour 65 or the base

97
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,700
needle 65 and then the width of the needles will be three pixels.

98
00:08:59,470 --> 00:08:59,850
All right.

99
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,320
So you can see it's positioned right here.

100
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:10,300
Now, one thing I want to add to this is a transform origin because we are going to rotate these needles

101
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,200
or these hands.

102
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,390
I see needle or hand.

103
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,350
I mean, the same thing.

104
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:21,160
So we're going to use, transform, rotate, but I don't want it to rotate like from the middle.

105
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:27,580
I want it to rotate from the bottom center, you know, so it goes like this.

106
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,520
I mean, I can't really show you with my mouse, but you know what I mean.

107
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,840
I don't want it to spin on the middle.

108
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,970
I want to spin on the bottom center.

109
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,030
So we're going to set the transform origin to bottom center.

110
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:48,370
OK, and then let's take, let's say, a needle and then hours so far as the our class.

111
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,580
It's set to transform

112
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,210
and we're going to translate because we want to move this up, right?

113
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:04,090
We want we want the bottom of this to be up here because this is basically the clock.

114
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,150
That's the square.

115
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:13,180
So let's translate on actually going to use translate because we want it to be directly in the middle

116
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,780
on the X axis, because right now, I mean, it looks like it's in the middle, but it's the beginning

117
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,480
that's in the middle.

118
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:31,570
So let's say negative 50 percent on X and then we want to move it up negative 100 percent.

119
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,800
Now, this right here is the our needle, right.

120
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,980
These down here, this is still the other two because we have three.

121
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,510
We have the hour, minute and second.

122
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,570
So all we moved right now is the hour.

123
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,140
Now, we also want to add a rotate because that's how we're going to have this thing move.

124
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:57,460
So let's set it's going to be set to zero degrees initially, which if I say if it's the same thing,

125
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:02,470
if I set it to, let's say, 30 degrees, you'll see that it rotates like a clock.

126
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,040
So, I mean, we'll get into that later.

127
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,950
But that's how we're going to make this thing move is with transform rotate now for the minute.

128
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,280
Let's see.

129
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:18,520
We're just going to copy this because we want it in the same position, let's say eight minutes.

130
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,980
And this is going to be the same.

131
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,540
It's going to start at zero degrees.

132
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,890
But I want the height instead of sixty five pixels.

133
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,540
I want it to be 100 pixels.

134
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:34,000
So if I save that now, you can see that we have the minute placed here as well.

135
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,230
But it's longer.

136
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:43,330
In fact, if I rotate this 30 and save, you'll see that now the longer hand is rotated 30 degrees.

137
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,010
But we wanted to start at zero now for the second, let's.

138
00:11:49,720 --> 00:12:00,430
Just take this and let's change this to our second hand or second Neidl, and then this can stay the

139
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,130
same, let's the hike and stay the same as well.

140
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,970
What I want to change is the background color, and I want it to be reddish color.

141
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:20,860
So it's going to be hexadecimal E seven four, C, three C, so it's like a reddish orange kind of color.

142
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:26,230
And you see if I rotate that, so that's going to be our second hand.

143
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:33,470
Now, the center point, which is right here where we have a dive for that did with the class of Centerpoint,

144
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:39,070
we're going to want to style that to be like a circle with a border.

145
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:44,510
So I think that we can stop here and we'll continue on with this in the next video, because there's

146
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,250
still quite a bit of success left.

147
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,280
And I don't want the video to take up too much time.

148
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:49,900
All right.

149
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,910
I'll see you in the next one and we'll finish this up.
