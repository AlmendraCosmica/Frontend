1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:06,450
OK, so we're going to get started now, this project is very heavy, that's what we're going to mostly

2
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,430
be focusing on.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,010
We do need to add some JavaScript to have the hover effect.

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,320
But a lot of this is going to be styling.

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,320
So the HTML is actually going to be really simple.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,760
Let's just jump right in here.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,140
And this is a split landing page.

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,480
And I don't know, I just did that.

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,830
And we're going to get rid of this one.

10
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,300
And let's wrap everything in a container and then we're going to have the left and the right.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:38,820
So both of these are going to have a class of split.

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,430
And this one will be the left.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,470
So we'll also give it a class of left.

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,930
And then and here it will be.

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:53,910
Let's do an H1, say, PlayStation five, which is definitely my choice.

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,570
And then we'll have a link formatted as a button.

17
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,380
So I'm going to give this a class of B10 and it's not going to actually go anywhere.

18
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,850
And then for the text in here, we're going to say bye now.

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,250
OK, and then what we'll do is just copy this.

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,710
So this whole div right here, we're going to copy that down and just change this to.

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:17,280
Right.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:27,150
So this is the right side and we're going to change this to Xbox Series X and by now.

23
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:27,790
And that's it.

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,140
So very simple html it's going to look like this.

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,180
So we're going to jump into our stylesheet I'm going to use the Roboto font, so we're going to keep

26
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,630
that.

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,750
And then for the body, I'm not going to use Flex, so I'm going to get rid of all of these.

28
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,190
And yeah, so that should be all set for the body.

29
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:50,730
Now I'm trying to figure out what we should style first.

30
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,540
Let's do we'll do the content.

31
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,990
Looks like the the heading in the in the button.

32
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,710
So let's start with the container which wraps around everything.

33
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:10,950
We want to position that to be relative and we want that to have a width of 100 percent and a height

34
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:19,150
of 100 percent and then the background so that two, three, three, three, which is a dark gray.

35
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,570
All right.

36
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:29,550
And this space up here is from the the margin on the heading now for the split.

37
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,250
Remember, both sides have a class of split.

38
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:42,630
So we're going to position the split absolu within the container and the width is going to be 50 percent.

39
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,290
So each one will be 50 percent, the height will be 100 percent.

40
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:50,730
And the overflow, we want that to be hidden.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,760
All right.

42
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,080
So now it's positioned.

43
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,810
Let's do this, the left side.

44
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:07,890
So if we say split and we want to target the left side, so left, I'm going to set from the left zero.

45
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:14,590
And let's add the background, which is going to be a neutral.

46
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:20,010
Now, I didn't actually bring the images into this yet, so I'm just going to grab these and you can

47
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,350
get these in the repository.

48
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,380
And of course, you can use any images that you'd like.

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,910
So I'm just going to bring these over so we have the five of the Xbox.

50
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,550
So these are the two images that I'm using.

51
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:37,050
The left side is going to be the five.

52
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:44,490
So in here, let's say JPEG, OK, so we can see the background and we're going to add an overlay to

53
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:47,100
each side, but at least we have the background.

54
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,910
And then I just want to set the background, let's say background repeat.

55
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:59,940
I'm going to set to no repeat and background size, I'm going to set to cover.

56
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,800
So we see the whole thing.

57
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,240
All right.

58
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,980
So that's good.

59
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,350
Now for the overlay, actually.

60
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,660
Let's do the right first and then we'll do the overlay.

61
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,500
So let's say split with the class of.

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,040
Right.

63
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,670
And we want to position that on the right side.

64
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,230
So from the right zero and let's add the background.

65
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,170
So background is going to be neutral and it's going to be Xbox JPEG.

66
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,190
And let's set the background.

67
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,430
I forgot my semicolon here.

68
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:43,440
So background repeat will be no repeat in the background size to cover.

69
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:44,400
All right.

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,270
So I save that.

71
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:50,880
Now we have both images side by side, so now we'll go ahead and do the overlays.

72
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,920
So we'll start with the left overlay.

73
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,650
So we're going to use split left and then the before pseudo selector sokolenko them before.

74
00:04:59,190 --> 00:04:59,930
And we're so.

75
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,880
Actually, styling like you can think of it as a ghost element that we're going to place over the left

76
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,580
side, so when we used before or after, we have to use a content property and we're just going to put

77
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,530
in just an empty string for that.

78
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:23,520
And then we want to position this to be absolute and it's going to have a width of 100 percent of its

79
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,210
container.

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,140
Same thing with height.

81
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:27,000
That's also going to be 100 percent.

82
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,110
And then we want the overlay, which is going to be a background color.

83
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,350
Now, I'm going to I'm going to put this in a custom property or variable just so it's easy to change.

84
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:48,750
So let's do Vare and we'll call this dash dash left, dash BGI dash color.

85
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,450
OK, and then let's go up to the top here.

86
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,530
And we want to define on a root scope.

87
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:07,860
Dash, dash, what I call it, left dash, B.G., dash color, and it's going to be a red, green,

88
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,860
blue Alfa because we needed to have some transparency so we can see the image behind the overlay.

89
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,420
So the color is going to be a bluish color.

90
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:24,720
So 87 for red, 84 for green and 236 for blue, and then for the alpha value will be zero point seven.

91
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:25,860
All right.

92
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:30,570
So if I go ahead and save that, I can see we have this blue overlay and while we're at it, we might

93
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,760
as well do the right overlay.

94
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,920
So let's change this to write big color.

95
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:44,500
And that's going to be it's going to be a little lighter than blacks.

96
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,180
We're going to do 43 for red, green and blue.

97
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:57,810
And then for the alpha value, let's do zero point eight and then we'll go down here and where we have

98
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,500
our split left before.

99
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:08,620
I'm just going to grab that and go under the right here and let's change this to split dot.

100
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,210
Right.

101
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,730
So now we're targeting the right side.

102
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,500
And let's see, this stuff here is going to be the same, 100 percent, and then the color is going

103
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:28,170
to be the right color, which just makes it a you know, it's like a gray, dark gray.

104
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:29,790
All right.

105
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,660
So that's good.

106
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:35,900
Now it's you trying to think what I want to do next.

107
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,480
Let's let's dial style the content now that's inside of it.

108
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,260
So we have the text, the H1 and the button that we want to style.

109
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,740
So let's do the H1 one first and I'm going to put that right up here.

110
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,110
See each one.

111
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,310
I'm going to increase the font size.

112
00:07:55,320 --> 00:08:03,210
Let's do forum units and the color is going to be white and we want to position it.

113
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,570
So it's to position absolute.

114
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:12,750
So it's going to be position absolute on its in whatever side here and we want each one to be in the

115
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,300
middle.

116
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:22,920
So what we'll do is say from the left 50 percent and from the top we'll do 20 percent.

117
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:28,650
Now if I do that, it's going to put the beginning of the H1 right in the middle.

118
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,520
And that's not what I want.

119
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,300
I want the middle of the H1 in the middle of the of the side.

120
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:41,730
So to do that, we just need to add a transform and we're going to transform on translate X.

121
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,020
So we're going to move it on the X axis, negative 50 percent.

122
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,250
And now it's going to put it, you know, right in the middle.

123
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,380
Now, I don't want them to go on the next slide.

124
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,240
I don't want this to wrap even if this is smaller.

125
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,510
Like if I spent spane this out, it's on one line.

126
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,990
But even if it's smaller like this, I don't want it to wrap.

127
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,940
So we need to set the whitespace property.

128
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:10,950
So let's say white space and we're going to set that to no wrap.

129
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,040
So now, even if, you know, even if it's like that, it's still not going to rap, which is what I

130
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,370
want.

131
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,220
OK, so that's the one.

132
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,310
And now I think what we'll do is style the button.

133
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:28,850
And then in the next video we'll do the hover stuff and add our JavaScript and the rest of the season.

134
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,240
But let's dial the button.

135
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:36,030
So that has a class of buttons and it's going to close that up.

136
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,360
So first thing I'm going to do here is position it.

137
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,910
So let's say position absolute.

138
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,990
It's going to position the absolute within its container, within its side, and we want it to be in

139
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,470
the middle.

140
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:57,480
So let's say left 50 percent and let's do from the top will say 40 percent.

141
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,840
Now, that's going to put the beginning of it in the middle, right.

142
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,760
So this year we want the middle in the middle.

143
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:13,680
So we're going to add trends form, transform and then translate X negative 50 percent.

144
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,090
That's going to put it right in the middle.

145
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,680
And then let's take away that underline.

146
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:29,220
So text decoration is going to be none and the color is going to be white and we're going to add a border

147
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,050
of whites.

148
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,130
So that and solid and the width.

149
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:38,460
I'm going to use a RIM unit, so just point to room for the width.

150
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:46,890
OK, so we have our border, let's make the font size, we'll do one room for the font size and then

151
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,520
for the width of the button we'll do fifteen REM.

152
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,420
And then let's add padding of one point.

153
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:06,220
Five a.m. and then we want the text to be in the middle, so what I'm going to do is actually display

154
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,280
as flex and then we'll line items center and justify content center.

155
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,490
And let's also make it bold.

156
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:25,000
So let's see right in the font size will say font weight and set that to bold.

157
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,250
And I want it to be upper case as well.

158
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,650
So add text, transform into uppercase.

159
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:43,370
OK, so it looks pretty good and I think that's it as far as the button styles go.

160
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:49,060
Now we do want to have C yeah.

161
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:54,570
We do want to have a background color when we hover over these.

162
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:01,620
So let's actually define that as a variable up here so those can easily be changed.

163
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:13,800
So we'll say dash dash left, let's do left btn so left Betty and dash hover dash color.

164
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:22,300
And that's actually going to be the same as this except no transparency.

165
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,780
So instead of zero point seven for the alpha value will do one.

166
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:26,850
All right.

167
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:36,660
And then for the right let's say right button hover and that's going to be something different.

168
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:44,680
It's going to be the Xbox Green which is twenty eight one twenty two twenty eight.

169
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:46,240
And we're going to keep it solid.

170
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:46,930
So one.

171
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,370
And now we can go down here to the button

172
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:07,450
and let's add, let's say split left dot btn hover and we want to set the background, let's say a background

173
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:07,900
color.

174
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:15,430
We're going to set that to the variable or the custom property of dash dash left button hover color

175
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,630
and the border color because it has a white border by default, actually want the border to be the same

176
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:23,560
as this as well.

177
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,740
So let's change the border color to that.

178
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,150
So if I go over and I hover, OK, nothing's happening when I do split.

179
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:43,240
Split left button, hover background color.

180
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,850
Oh, I forgot my semicolons up here.

181
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:55,620
All right, now we get that blue hover, right, and then we'll do the same for the right side.

182
00:13:55,630 --> 00:14:10,540
So let's just grab that and change this to rights and change this and this to right as well.

183
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:15,820
Now, come over here and we get that Xbox screen, however, call it so in the next video, we have

184
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,050
a little bit more access to.

185
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:17,410
Right.

186
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,590
Because we have to handle how wide we want it to go when we hover.

187
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:27,220
And of course, we have to add the hover effect by adding, adding and removing classes with JavaScript.

188
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:29,170
So we'll get into that in the next video.
