1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,700
All right, so now comes the fun part and, well, I guess it depends on who you are.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,200
Some people do like the UI, the CSI stuff, but I like to make things actually function.

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:14,210
So we're going to jump into the JavaScript and let's bring in everything we need.

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:22,710
So we'll say the our element document dots and I'm going to use query selector and we want to grab the

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,610
class of our.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,910
So it's going to be the needled class of our and let's just copy this down a bunch of times.

7
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:38,640
So we want the our we want the minute and the second and let's change these variable names.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:49,880
So this will be minute elements and second element and then this is going to be for the time.

9
00:00:52,080 --> 00:01:01,680
So that has a class of time and we want the date so date and we also want the toggle switch or toggle

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,120
button.

11
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:08,970
So this over here will be the date element and then this will be the toggle.

12
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:09,950
All right.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,580
So that's all the stuff we need to bring in.

14
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:18,180
So we want to create a couple arrays, one for days and one for months.

15
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,930
And and you'll see why in a little bit.

16
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,040
But I'm just going to season because there's no reason for you to watch me type this out.

17
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:31,230
It's just two arrays, one call days, Sunday through Saturday, one called months, January through

18
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:31,770
December.

19
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,670
So very simple.

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,780
And before we do anything with the date, the time or the clock, I want to handle the dark mode, which

21
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,830
is going to be pretty simple.

22
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:48,660
Basically, we just need to change the R add, add or remove the class of dark to to the HTML element.

23
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,680
And we also want to change the text of this.

24
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,190
Right now we're in regular or light mode, so it says dark mode.

25
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,010
If you change the dark mode, it should then say light mode.

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,050
So this isn't going to be too hard at all.

27
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,760
We just want to take our toggle button.

28
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:08,910
If you guys want to pause the video and figure this out, you know, I'm sure that a lot of you can

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,680
do can do this without watching.

30
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,490
So I'm going to continue here and just add an event listener.

31
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:24,990
So we want to listen for a click and let's pass in a function here with our event object and create

32
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,760
a variable here called HTML.

33
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,360
And then we're just going to use document dot, query selector and we're going to select the HTML element.

34
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:39,990
So basically the root element and we're going to check to see if it has the class of dark.

35
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:46,650
So let's say if html dot class list dot and then there's contains method.

36
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:57,480
If it contains dark then let's take HTML and let's take our class list object and call the remove method.

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,350
Here we want to remove dark and let's also set e dot target, which means the element we click on,

38
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,580
which is the toggle button.

39
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,170
We're going to set the HTML.

40
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,930
I do in here in our HTML.

41
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:19,860
We're going to set that to dark mode because we're in light mode, right.

42
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,430
If it contains dark and then we remove, it means red light mode.

43
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:31,110
So we want the button to say dark mode or else then let's just copy this.

44
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,280
And instead of remove, we want to add the class of dark and we want to change the text here to light

45
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:38,610
mode.

46
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:39,840
All right.

47
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,370
So let's go over here and let's click it.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,880
And you can see it fades into dark mode.

49
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:51,900
The button is now light and the text in all that is all the correct colour because of, you know, the

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,150
primary and secondary colours, which we defined up here basically on the root scope.

51
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,370
It's it's the light mode colours.

52
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,710
But if the if HTML has a class of dark, then it's going to be reversed.

53
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:09,900
OK, so and we have that transition because we did add a success transition.

54
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,410
So that's that's the easy part.

55
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,350
Now we want to do the the clock.

56
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:23,430
So we're going to have let's go under the event listener here and let's create a function called Set

57
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,270
Time.

58
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:35,820
So first thing I'm going to do is set a variable of time and set it to new date and just to show you

59
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,140
what that gives us or console long time here and I open up my console.

60
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,400
Actually, we have to call this set time.

61
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:51,580
And it gives me this, all right, now, with this time variable, I can get specific things like the

62
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,400
month, the day, the hours, all that stuff.

63
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,980
So I'm going to put those into separate variables.

64
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:03,880
So for the month, we can set we can get it from time, dot, and then there's a get month method that

65
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,200
we can call to get that.

66
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:11,350
Let's do the day so we can do time, dot get day.

67
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,760
And if you want to console log these to see exactly what it gives you, you can do that.

68
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,610
Let's get the hours.

69
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:23,830
So time to get ours and then we want the hours for the clock.

70
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,950
Because remember the clock is is what.

71
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,400
It's 12 hours.

72
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:27,570
Right.

73
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,260
It's not a 24 hour clock.

74
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:32,680
I mean you could do that if you want, but I'm going to make it a 12 hour clock.

75
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,650
So let's say hours for a clock.

76
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,780
We're going to set that to whatever the hours is with Modulus.

77
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,690
We can use the modulus operator from twelve.

78
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,640
So whatever the remainder is basically.

79
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:55,570
And then for the minutes, say, koans minutes, we can use time to get minutes.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,950
Make sure you put parentheses on these gets and then seconds.

81
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,940
So consed seconds equals time, doget seconds.

82
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:07,750
All right.

83
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,230
So that will give us a whole bunch of stuff.

84
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,430
Now as far as.

85
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:20,420
Making the clock work, let's just close that up, because that ruins the UI here and of course, you

86
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:25,660
could put the button somewhere else if you want, but basically we want to take each of the needles.

87
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,230
So like the our element and we want to set the on the style.

88
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:35,210
We want to set the transform, OK.

89
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,740
And set it to some back text.

90
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,920
Now, in our success, you can see for like the hour we have transform translate negative 50, negative

91
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,460
100.

92
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,640
And then the rotate is what we really want to focus on here.

93
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,230
The rotate is going to depend on the time.

94
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:58,880
So let's just copy this and we'll just just put that right in there like that so that if I say if it's

95
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,200
not going to look any different, if I change this to, you know, 30 degrees.

96
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,380
Why isn't that working?

97
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,100
Transform.

98
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,070
Oh, I copied this, too.

99
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,630
There we go.

100
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:17,480
So you can see that now the our hand is rotated 30 degrees.

101
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,490
So this obviously needs to be dynamic and it needs to pertain to whatever the time is.

102
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,670
Now, the way we're going to do this is by using very helpful utility function that I've actually used

103
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,070
in quite a few projects in this course.

104
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,900
And that's the scale function.

105
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,210
So I'm going to paste this in.

106
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:40,570
I'm using an arrow function and it needs to be above set time where we actually use it.

107
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,310
And this is the link to the stack overflow page.

108
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,790
And this comes in handy because what we need to do is, is map, as it says right here, map a range

109
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,880
of numbers to another range of numbers.

110
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:56,100
So we want to map the hours, which is, you know, 12.

111
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,060
So it's essentially zero to eleven.

112
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:05,830
We want to map that to zero to 360 because there's 360 degrees in our clock in our circle.

113
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,450
So four rotate.

114
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:16,160
Let's go ahead and pass in our variable syntax and we're going to set that call scale.

115
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,950
And the numbers of the first argument we want to pass in is going to be hours for clock.

116
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:29,870
OK, so the hours, 4:00 right now for me, it's one thirty eight p.m. so this should be one and then

117
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,210
the inmind.

118
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:36,440
So the minimum end is going to be zero, the maximum 11.

119
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,910
So it's zero to eleven, which which is a 12 hour format.

120
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:49,760
And then we want to map that to zero to 360, OK, because it's 360 degrees and then we want to just

121
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,360
add the digits here, just like we have here.

122
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,140
It has to have that.

123
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,410
So if I save that now, you can see that the hour hand is placed in a specific position.

124
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:11,060
And if we look at it, let's look at the div here for our and it has a rotate value of thirty two point

125
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,280
seven to seven three degrees.

126
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:21,260
So it basically took the time, the hours for clock and mapped that to a position in the 360 degree

127
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,160
clock.

128
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,790
OK, we want to do the same thing, four minutes and seconds.

129
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,380
So let's grab that and paste that in and let's do the minutes.

130
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:35,630
So we'll take the minute element and and then rotate here.

131
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:40,550
We're going to use scale, but we don't want to use ours for clock because now we're dealing with minutes.

132
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,870
So we want minutes, which we got from here.

133
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:50,330
And then instead of zero to 11, we want zero to 59.

134
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:57,300
OK, so 60 Minutes in an hour and then we want to map that to zero to 360.

135
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,540
So if I save that now, the minute hand is over here and then the same thing, four seconds.

136
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:16,830
So second element, we want to scale seconds and that's also zero to fifty nine to three 360 degrees.

137
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,300
Now, right now, it's just clock that's kind of frozen in time.

138
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,830
We want it to to operate.

139
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,730
We want it to tick.

140
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,610
So the set time, we need to keep calling this.

141
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:33,140
So will you set interval, which takes in a function which in our case is set time and we want to call

142
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,290
that every second.

143
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,310
So every 1000 milliseconds and they'll save.

144
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:44,450
And now you can see that the second hand is going to tick every second and you should move along as

145
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:44,810
well.

146
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,050
All right.

147
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,160
So we have that working.

148
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,480
Let's just try out a transition to the needle.

149
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:10,410
Yeah, let's do a transition here, so set transition to transition all to zero point five seconds and

150
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,390
ease in just so it kind of when these move, I mean, you're going to barely see them move just like

151
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,380
on a regular clock.

152
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,430
But when they do, we want to transition now.

153
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,970
We want to handle this part here, which is the time and the date.

154
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:31,980
So let's go into set time below, you know, where we set all the the hands or needles, whatever you

155
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,700
want to call them.

156
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,290
And every time it reaches the end, you know, it's going to do that spin, but it should be accurate.

157
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:42,090
So what do we want to do here?

158
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,830
Let's take our time element.

159
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,420
All right.

160
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,790
So our time element, we want to set the inner HTML.

161
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,640
So there's two ways we can do this.

162
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,910
We can use ours, which will give us, you know, military time.

163
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,280
It'll be when it's one o'clock, it'll say 13 and then 14, 15, so on.

164
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,380
Or we can do the 12 hour clock.

165
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:09,630
I'm going to go with the 12 hour clock.

166
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,370
So I'm going to set it to its back ticks here.

167
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:20,520
And we want to use if you want to do the twenty four hour clock, you can use ours.

168
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,440
I'm going to use ours for clock.

169
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,240
All right.

170
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,670
And then we'll have a colon and then we want the minutes.

171
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:33,300
Now, we do want to have a zero in front of the minute.

172
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:33,720
Right?

173
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:37,080
So if it's if it's twelve or five.

174
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,440
Right.

175
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,090
We don't want it to just say twelve colon five, which is what minutes gives us.

176
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,580
So we want to check to see if it's less than ten.

177
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,310
If it is then we'll add a zero.

178
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:54,750
So here, let's open up another, you know, variable syntax and let's say if minutes I'm going to use

179
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,710
a ternary here.

180
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,910
So if minutes is less than ten then let's add a zero.

181
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:12,330
So we'll put in a set of tactics and say zero and then whatever the whatever the minutes is.

182
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:18,090
And then we'll go outside of the back ticks here and say else then just put in whatever the minutes

183
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,390
is.

184
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,250
So let's save that.

185
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,350
And you can see I get one forty three.

186
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:29,850
Now at the moment there's no way to tell if this is a.m. or p.m. I mean you're probably going to know,

187
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,270
but we should put that somewhere.

188
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:39,390
So what we'll do is add let's add a variable up here, call it AMPM.

189
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:44,010
And the way that we can get this is by checking the hours.

190
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:45,810
So I'll use a ternary here.

191
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:55,020
I'll say if ours is greater than or equal to twelve, then let's set PMB else.

192
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:02,400
Let's set this string to an OK and then we'll go down here and right after five minutes let's put in

193
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,140
ampm.

194
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,020
So now I get one forty four p.m..

195
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:17,130
So for the date let's do that, let's go right here and say date element and I'm going to set that equal

196
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:19,110
to some tactics.

197
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:23,790
And in here this is where we're going to use our days in Monterrey.

198
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:35,790
So I'll say day or days and I want to use the day that I got from here as an index for the days, OK,

199
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,750
because it's going to be, you know, zero one, two, three and so on.

200
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,960
So that'll give us the day.

201
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:52,410
And then for the month, let's put a comma here and oops, not there here, because we want like this

202
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,560
Monday and then comma and then November or whatever the whatever the month is.

203
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:07,140
So let's take the months away and for the index we're going to use the month that we got from up here.

204
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,330
All right.

205
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,070
And then let's see.

206
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,020
So we have that, then we have a span.

207
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:20,340
So let's put a spanner in here, give it a class, let's use a circle

208
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,610
span.

209
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:32,400
And then in here is where we want the day so we can actually just put in here the date variable, which

210
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,160
wait a minute, we not put this.

211
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,620
We didn't do this.

212
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,340
All right.

213
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:47,250
So let's copy this down another day and let's say date and set that to get date.

214
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,560
All right.

215
00:15:52,950 --> 00:16:00,390
So I saved that and now I should be able to get rid of everything that we have inside this div with

216
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:06,150
the class of date, and if I save should get rid of this to.

217
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,580
And that's see, that's not showing up.

218
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:17,950
Oh, I need to set in our HTML and then we go so we get the same thing Monday, November 2nd.

219
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,650
OK, so now this works.

220
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,670
This is dynamic.

221
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,700
We can change to dark motor light mode.

222
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:30,520
And hopefully this just gives you a better understanding of how to deal with, like, success and changing

223
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,210
specific styles and stuff like that.

224
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,020
All right.

225
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,430
So that's going to be it for this project.

226
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,400
Guys, I hope you enjoyed this and I will see you in the next one.
