1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,880
OK, so let's get started on our password image strength project, whatever you want to call it.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:13,450
We'll go ahead and just call this password password strength background.

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,900
Now, this is going to be a little different because we're actually going to use Tailwind CSFs, which

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,900
is a framework access framework, just so we don't have to actually write a lot of success.

5
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,610
And it's just a really cool framework.

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:35,610
We're not going to get deep into it and, you know, and compile it or anything like that.

7
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,020
We're just going to use a CDN.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:46,620
So if we go to a CDN J.S. dot com and just type in tailwind, we want to grab this and this right here,

9
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,560
this tailwind dot access.

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,270
We're going to copy that link tag.

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,450
And let's put that right above our custom style access and we'll save that.

12
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:02,660
You can see the font already changed and we're now using the default tailwind access.

13
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,320
So for the HTML, let's let's close this.

14
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,010
First of all, actually will open up the rest of our files here and then close that and let's get rid

15
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,990
of this H1 here.

16
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:24,690
So I want to have a background image that we can work with to, you know, add that blur effect to.

17
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:33,090
So I'm going to have a div here with the class of background and also an I.D. of background and nothing's

18
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:33,980
going to go inside of it.

19
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,030
We're just going to use that for the background.

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,930
And then let's have basically a wrapper around everything and we're going to give us a few tailwind

21
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,490
classes like BGU Dash White.

22
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,300
So this is going to be the box in the middle with the with the form the form fields.

23
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,040
I'm also going to make it rounded.

24
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,080
So we'll add rounded and these are tailwind classes so we don't have to actually create the access for

25
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,380
this.

26
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,730
Want some padding.

27
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:02,850
So I'm going to do p dash tend to do padding all around.

28
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,790
I want center so text center and let's add a shadow to it as well.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,340
So Shadow will do shadow MMD Shadow Medium.

30
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:13,260
All right.

31
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,830
Now and again, these are Tailwind classes.

32
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:20,550
If you're interested in tailwind, I have a crash course on YouTube.

33
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,720
There's there's a lot of videos on YouTube is paid and free courses.

34
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,080
It's a really, really cool framework if you want to look more into it.

35
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,540
So here I'm going to have an H1.

36
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,900
I'm going to give this a class of text, dash three Excel to make it a little bigger.

37
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:44,200
And inside here, we're just going to say image, password, strength.

38
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,970
You can put whatever you want.

39
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:48,930
I'm just putting that.

40
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,240
And then we'll put a paragraph here.

41
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:58,170
I'm going to give this paragraph a class of text which will make the text smaller and then text dash

42
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:03,570
grea dash 700, which will give it a shade of grey.

43
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:10,050
And we're just going to say change the password to see the effect.

44
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,020
All right.

45
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,510
And then under that paragraph, we're going to have a div.

46
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:17,910
Let's give this a class of Mooi.

47
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,530
So my intelligence is margined on the Y axis, which is top and bottom.

48
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm going to do dash four and it's also do text dash left.

49
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,540
And in the stiv here, we're going to have our label and our input for the email.

50
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,810
So let's add let's just go down here a little bit.

51
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,890
Let's add a label.

52
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,440
So the label is going to have a class.

53
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,890
We'll do text Gray Dash nine hundred.

54
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,520
And in the Slovo, we're just going to say email whoops.

55
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,330
Oh yeah.

56
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:49,680
We can say for email.

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,340
And then inside here we want to say email and then under that label we're going to have our input.

58
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,190
So this input is going to have a few classes.

59
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,970
We're going to have border, let's do block.

60
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,700
So it's a block level, it reaches all the way across.

61
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,740
Let's make sure the width is full.

62
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:17,130
So w dash full padding to P two once a margin on the top, so empty dash two and I want it rounded.

63
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:19,080
So I'm going to add the rounded class.

64
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:27,000
OK, and then we want to have a few other attributes so we have input type text in the classes.

65
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:36,450
I'm also going to add an idea of email and I'm going to add a placeholder as well and just say enter.

66
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,590
Email.

67
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:47,940
All rights that should be good, it's actually put a call in after the label so you can see over here

68
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,320
we have our email now we want to do the passwords.

69
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,630
I'm going to copy this div that wraps the label and the input.

70
00:04:55,220 --> 00:05:00,450
You know, let's put that here and just change this to password.

71
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:07,440
Let's change the type two password and the classes here.

72
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:17,020
We can actually just leave those the I.D. password and the placeholder enter password.

73
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,450
All right.

74
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,090
So now we have our two fields.

75
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:22,710
The last thing we want is the button.

76
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:29,730
So let's go outside of this div here and let's put in a button here.

77
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,310
So this is going to have quite a few classes.

78
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:40,680
I want BGU Dash Black and let's do text dash white and for padding, let's do piecewise of padding on

79
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,930
the top and bottom two and let's do margined top to push it down a bit.

80
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,700
Will do empty two.

81
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,850
And I want to display this actually it's too empty for and I want this to be an inline block.

82
00:05:53,970 --> 00:06:00,930
So we'll add the inline block class and let's do with dash full and rounded.

83
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:04,410
OK, so those are the classes we want for the text.

84
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:13,770
We'll just say submit and let's give it a type of submit as well, even though it doesn't really matter.

85
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,130
But we'll just go ahead and save that good.

86
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,420
All right.

87
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,480
So now for this for the customer access, let's go to our stylesheet.

88
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,090
A lot of the styling is already there from the tail when utility classes.

89
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,650
But we want to give it that background image with the blur.

90
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,310
So as far as what we have in our default styling, I'm just going to get rid of the fonts.

91
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:39,270
We don't need to include that with Castalian has its own font.

92
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:48,390
And then for the styling of the background, we have a class of background and all that is, is a div

93
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,170
at the top.

94
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:49,950
Right.

95
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,000
So we want this to cover everything and we want to add the background image to that.

96
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,910
So let's first of all, set the background image.

97
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:04,170
So it's going to set background to a neutral and the image link I'm going to paste in.

98
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:09,120
And you can if you want to use the same image, you can just you know, you can either copy this, you

99
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,650
can get it from the repository.

100
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:17,580
Let's set it to no repeat and let's set the positioning to center center on the X and Y axis and then

101
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,840
cover for the background size.

102
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,240
Now, we're not going to see anything just yet because it's just an empty div.

103
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,920
We want to position this to be absolute and we want to set I'm going to set the top to be a little further

104
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,000
than the edge.

105
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:39,960
So we'll do negative twenty pixels and let's set bottom to negative twenty.

106
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:49,470
We're going to set it on all sides of top bottom left, negative twenty and write negative twenty.

107
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,250
And if I do that we're going to see the image here.

108
00:07:53,250 --> 00:08:01,740
Now it's it's covering, it's covering the, the login box which obviously we don't want.

109
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,870
So we'll just change the Z index.

110
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,650
Let's make this the index to negative one and then the login box will be on top of it.

111
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:13,860
Now I want to start start the image out to be blurred.

112
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:20,160
And then the longer the password gets, the less the the the less of a blur the image will have.

113
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:26,970
So insists we have this filter property and we're going to use Blur and we're going to set it to twenty

114
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,900
pixels blur like that.

115
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,620
So basically the higher this is, if I set this to thirty, it's going to be even more blurry, but

116
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:41,760
we're going to set it to twenty zero obviously is knobler ten is a little blurry, but we're going to

117
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,040
set this to twenty to start off with.

118
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:48,150
OK, so that's all we need to do for the HTML and access.

119
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,530
In the next video we're going to do the JavaScript which should be really, really quick.

120
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,350
It's only like nine lines of code or something like that.

121
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,950
All right.

122
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,970
So we'll do that next.
