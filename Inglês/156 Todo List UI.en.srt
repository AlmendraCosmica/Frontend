1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,150
OK, so we're going to start on our To-Do list, so we jump into the HTML here and let's change the

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:13,560
title to to do list and for the body, we're not going to have much.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:20,070
Basically, we're going to just have let's do an H1 will say to DOS and a form which I'm going to give

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,390
the idea of form.

5
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,010
And let's see, we don't need an action.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,750
And then in this form we're just going to have one input.

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,200
So let's do an input with the class of input and also an idea of input.

8
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:42,090
It's going to be text and then I'm going to set the placeholder.

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,900
And we'll say enter your to do and I'm also going to set autocomplete to off.

10
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,880
OK, under that input, we're going to have a little and give that a class of to DOS and an I.D. of

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,580
to DOS.

12
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,160
Now this all the list items will get put in here.

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,080
When we add our to do so, it will be dynamic, you know, added to do in the input and then it'll get

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,270
shown as the list item.

15
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,730
But for now, I'm just going to put a sample list item.

16
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:18,290
We'll just say my first.

17
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,330
To do its put to actually.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,810
OK, so that's our time.

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,730
Let's jump in to our stylesheet, and we're going to be using the Poppins font.

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:43,520
Poppins, and then we want to set the weight here to 200, 400, and for the body, let's set a background,

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,640
color, background, color.

22
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,720
We're going to do five, three times, which is a light gray.

23
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:57,170
And then the color we'll do four, four, four, which makes it a little lighter.

24
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:02,660
And we want to display flex line items now.

25
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,980
Flex direction.

26
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,180
Yeah, we'll keep flex direction as column the rest of the.

27
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:10,660
Yeah.

28
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,350
The rest of us should be fine actually.

29
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:16,130
Let's take off overflow hidden just in case we need scroll bars.

30
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,890
OK, and then the one I'm going to make it look really nice.

31
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,570
So let's styled that.

32
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:32,690
So the color we're going to be and is going to be one seven nine four red one three one four green and

33
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,960
two two six four blue.

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,700
We're going to make it really big.

35
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,920
So let's do font size.

36
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,840
Set that to ten REM.

37
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,840
It's going to be nice and big and we're going to make sure we text the wine center and I want it to

38
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,290
be.

39
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,540
Faded or transparent, so we're going to see the opacity to zero point four.

40
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:55,850
All right.

41
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,610
So that's our one now the form.

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:11,590
Form, I'm going to set a box shadow and for the offsets we'll do to zero and for 10 pixels for the

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:16,450
blur gba for the color, which is going to be black and then zero point one.

44
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:26,730
Let's give it a max width of one hundred percent and let's give it a width of 400 pixels.

45
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,320
All right, so that's the form itself now, the input.

46
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,630
Let's do that next.

47
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:38,870
So we gave I gave it a class of input and I'm going to just say border none.

48
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,410
And the color for that is going to be four.

49
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:47,380
Four for the font size is going to be two REM.

50
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,700
OK, so nice and big.

51
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,730
And let's add some padding to the input.

52
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:56,020
Will do one REM top and bottom two REM left and right.

53
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:05,930
And let's set, let's make it display as a block level element and set the width of it to 100 percent

54
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,920
of its container.

55
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:15,540
I see that already looks pretty good placeholder, let's change the color of that or say input Kalanchoe

56
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,760
and placeholder and then color is going to be hexadecimal value D five three times.

57
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,250
So it's nice and light placeholder.

58
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,170
And then let's do the list item.

59
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,250
So these right here, those don't look very good.

60
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:40,230
So let's say input list item, not input list item to do list item.

61
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,740
So let's do the to dos first.

62
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,220
Set a background color on these of white.

63
00:04:53,490 --> 00:05:02,130
All right, and then let's set the padding on the to DOS to zero, and we want to get rid of those bullet

64
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:03,810
points, a LA style type.

65
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,180
We're going to set that to none.

66
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,870
And let's take off any margin as well.

67
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,070
OK, and then that should be good for to DOS.

68
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:27,270
Now for the allies, say, to Dos Elai, I'm going to set a border on the top for one pixel solid and

69
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,810
e five three times.

70
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,030
OK, so we can afford a top.

71
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,470
Let's give the cursor a pointer when we hover over them because we're going to be able to.

72
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:37,770
Right.

73
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,840
Click and delete them and also mark them as complete as well.

74
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:51,660
So the font size to make that bigger font size will do one point five REM and let's add some padding,

75
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:58,770
will do one room house, one room and two room on the sides.

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,230
All right.

77
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,390
So I think that looks pretty good.

78
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,540
Now, when they're completed, when they're completed, we're going to want a line through.

79
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:27,450
So let me just add manually a class here of completed and now here will say to DOS Ally, if it's completed,

80
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:36,470
then we're going to set the color to be six, three times.

81
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:38,910
And let's also give it a line through.

82
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:43,050
So text decoration will be set to line through.

83
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,990
OK, so if it's completed, it will look like that.

84
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,420
Now one thing I just realized is I forgot to put the little text at the bottom that says you left,

85
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,500
click the toggle complete and then right click to delete.

86
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:05,970
So we're going to go under the form here and let's add in some small tags and we'll say, say, left

87
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,550
click to toggle completed.

88
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,370
And then I want to just have a line break.

89
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:22,440
So we'll put a VR tag here and then say right click to delete to do.

90
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,460
All right, so that doesn't look very good, so we're just going to add a little bit of styling to the

91
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,060
small.

92
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:39,020
OK, so small, let's change the color or make it lighter, so I'm going to give it a value of five,

93
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,720
three times and let's move it down.

94
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,930
So margin top, I'm going to set two three ram to push it down and let's just text a line center.

95
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,080
OK, so I think that looks pretty good.

96
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,160
So now we have the UI here.

97
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:01,910
Let's actually make the outline of this the same color as the H1, though, so I'm going to grab that

98
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:11,110
right here and then let's take the input, so say input, colon focus.

99
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,550
So when it's in its focus state, we want the outline color.

100
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,480
To be that purple.

101
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:23,130
All right, cool.

102
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:29,910
So in the next video, we're going to make this function will be able to add to DOS and they'll get

103
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,130
SÃ¨vres to local storage, will be able to delete them and make them complete.

104
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:39,030
So I'm just gonna I'm going to get rid of the two list items that are in here now, because that was

105
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,440
just to see it and style it.

106
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,320
So ultimately, that's going to start with nothing.

107
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,300
So that's it.

108
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,210
Let's go ahead and jump into the JavaScript in the next video.
