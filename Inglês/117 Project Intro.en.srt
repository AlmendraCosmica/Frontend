00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,200
All right, guys, in this project, we're going to create a hoverboard, so it's just kind of a cool

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,010
little effect.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:07,610
We're going to paint these boxes onto the screen.

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,510
We're going to style them with success, and we're going to basically set a certain number.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:17,490
So right now, it's set to 500 in the JavaScript and it's going to paint that number of boxes.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,890
And then we're going to have event listeners for most over and most out so that when we hover over,

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,180
it's going to give us a random color.

8
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,100
OK, so you can see if I hover over that, it's blue, then it's purple.

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:35,580
So we'll have an array of colors that will basically have to choose from for each box when we hover

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:35,930
over it.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,530
So it gives us this cool effect.

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,650
And this could be used for some kind of drawing application or something like that will be using CSFs

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,370
transition.

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,010
So we have that cool fadeout effect as well.

15
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:47,660
All right.

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:48,950
So let's go ahead and get started.
