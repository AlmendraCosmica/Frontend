1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,100
All right, so before we jump in to our projects, I just want to go over my environment and what I'll

2
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,770
be using and there's not much to talk about because this is just vanilla JavaScript and HTML and access.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,850
So there's no frameworks or anything like that.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,030
Basically, the text editor I'm using is VSG Code Visual Studio Code, and that's what I recommend.

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,050
It's really popular on the Web dev community.

6
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,380
I'm sure a lot of you, if not most of you, are already using it.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,070
But you don't have to you can use sublime text or Adam or something like that or some other idea.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,250
That's absolutely fine.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,470
But if you want to follow along to a tee with this course, then I would suggest using voice code,

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:40,940
which you can get from Code Dot, Visual Studio, Dotcom.

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,510
Now, I just want to jump into voice code real quick and I just have my project starter, which we're

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,120
actually going to create in the next video.

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,950
But I want to talk a little bit about the extensions I'm using as well as Emet.

14
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,580
So Emet is a tool that's preinstalled with VAR code.

15
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:02,580
If you're using something like Ademir Sublime text, you have to install Emet as a plug in or an extension

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,070
and it just helps you write faster html.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,790
So if I want an H1, just H1 enter will give me my tags.

18
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,380
If I want to add a class I can do Dorte and then you know my class enter.

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:17,940
If I want to do two classes I could say my class to enter.

20
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,240
If I want to do an ID, I can do no sign and say my ID gives me an H1 with an ID.

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,820
If I want an ID and the class, I can do that.

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,570
OK, and if I'm using a div, I don't even need to.

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,500
I mean I can do div and then my class like that, but we don't even need to add the div we can just

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,420
to dot my class enter and it will automatically give us a div.

25
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,560
Same with the ID.

26
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,730
OK, and if we wanted like three divs, we can say d'Hiv and then times three, that'll give us three

27
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:50,970
d'Hiv.

28
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,820
So that's about the extent that I'll be using to I do have a complete crash course on YouTube on Emet,

29
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,280
if you want to learn more about it.

30
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,160
All right.

31
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:04,500
Now, let's take a look at the extensions I'm using so you don't need pretty much the only one I would

32
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,700
really suggest is live server that will allow you to open our project on a development server that will

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,570
auto reload.

34
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:18,600
Whenever we save either the HTML access or JavaScript, it'll auto reload so we don't have to keep clicking

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,500
the reload button.

36
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,220
Other than that, I'm using auto rename tag, which just renamed the end HTML tag.

37
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:33,420
Once you rename the beginning tag pretty self-explanatory bracket pair colorize are just colorize is

38
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,180
your brackets, your parentheses and curly braces.

39
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:39,900
You can see these outer curly braces are purple, the inner ones are blue.

40
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,950
If I had another set nested in the if those would be a different color as well.

41
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,820
And then I'm also using prettier which is a code formatter.

42
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,480
As far as formatting your code, I mean it's completely up to you.

43
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,300
I like to use single quotes as opposed to double quotes in my JavaScript.

44
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,070
I also don't use semicolons.

45
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,770
And to set that stuff you can just go to your settings with either command, command, comma, or you

46
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,500
can just click on the gear down here and go to settings.

47
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:15,480
And if you search for prettier, there's a bunch of, you know, options here for for your code.

48
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,030
I'm going to go down to this option here.

49
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,400
You can see I have semi unchecked.

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm not using semicolons.

51
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,810
I also have single, quote, checked tab with of two.

52
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,470
So, I mean, it's completely up to you on how you want to format your code.

53
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,830
And I'm also using format on save.

54
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,540
You can see that's checked.

55
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,160
What that means is if something is wrong, it'll fix it when I save.

56
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,290
So for instance, even in the HTML, if I'm like over here and I save, it goes back into place.

57
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:51,480
If I go into my JavaScript and I create a variable here, like const X equals double quotes, I will

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,610
just say test and put a semicolon.

59
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:59,250
If I save it, format's it to the way that I specified, which is no semicolons and single quotes.

60
00:03:59,550 --> 00:03:59,970
All right.

61
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,790
So I'm just going to get rid of that and that's it.

62
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,650
I mean, pretty simple stuff.

63
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,490
You can of course use whatever text editor you want, whatever settings you want.

64
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,140
I just wanted to show you what I'm working with.

65
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,800
All right.

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,610
So in the next video, we're going to start to create this little project starter, which we're going

67
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,240
to use as a boilerplate for all of our projects in this course.
