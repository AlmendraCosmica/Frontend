00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,040
All right, guys, so we're going to do quite a bit in this project.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,670
We're going to use the GitHub API to fetch users.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,180
We're going to able to search for GitHub users to get some of their profile data and display it in a

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:12,690
card.

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,080
And we're also going to make a separate request to get the user's latest five repositories, or however,

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,320
however many want to add, to add to the card.

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,040
So to give you an example here, I can search for a user.

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:32,850
I'll go ahead and search for myself and you'll see that my avatar pops up my name, my bio followers,

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,730
following my latest five repost.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,430
If I search for Floren Pop 17, you'll see the pull heads up.

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,260
So, of course you can search for your own.

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,420
And if I search for just something that isn't going to be a name, it'll say there's no profile with

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,230
this username.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,430
So we'll do a little bit of error handling as well.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:54,670
So these are the docs for the GitHub rest API.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,180
This is the newer version of the docs.

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,150
And you can basically see, you know, how you can fetch users and what kind of data you get.

18
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:08,760
And then the other thing we're going to do is use Axios instead of the fetch API.

19
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,660
So Axios is a library.

20
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,980
It's a promise based HDB client library for the browser and no Ge'ez.

21
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:25,740
So I prefer Axios personally when I do any kind of larger or medium size to larger projects, I'll use

22
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,460
axios.

23
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,050
It has better features.

24
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,800
In my opinion.

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:34,440
It's easier to use the error handling is better, so I definitely prefer it.

26
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,870
So I did want to add it to at least one of the projects in this course and we'll be using it with a

27
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,590
sink away.

28
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,700
But I'll show you how to use it just with regular, you know, then syntax as well.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,380
So that's what we'll be building.

30
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,300
Guys, hopefully you enjoy this project.

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,500
Let's go ahead and get into it.
