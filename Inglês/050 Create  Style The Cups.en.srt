1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,920
All right, guys, so we're going to bring out the timeline access for this drink water project, so

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,860
let's jump right into our next TML and for the title here, I'm going to change that to drink water

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,690
and then in the body, let's get rid of this one and we're going to have an one for the heading here

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,280
and just say drink water.

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:23,640
And underneath that will have an H3 with our goal.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,270
And our goal is going to be to leaders.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,960
And then underneath that, let's have a class of cup.

8
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,240
Now, this class of cup is going to be basically just like the shape of the cup, the the flat top and

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,090
then the rounded kind of shape.

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,800
And this is going to be used on the big cup and all the small cups, the eight small cups.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,500
So this first one we're doing, though, is going to be the big cup.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,640
And inside here, we're going to have a class of remained.

13
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,570
And this is basically going to have, you know, the the amount that is remaining for your goal.

14
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:05,850
So inside remained actually want to add an I.D. to this as well, because I'm going to use an ID to

15
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,620
grab onto it in the JavaScript.

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,570
So let's just say remained.

17
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:15,180
And then in here we'll have a span and let's give this an I.D. of leaders.

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,620
And for now, we'll put it in here one point five L and then we want a small tag with just kind of a

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,540
label that's just going to say remained.

20
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,110
Obviously, this span, this is going to change.

21
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,210
This small tag is not it's just static.

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,970
So underneath the remains div, but still within the cup, we're also going to have a percentage.

23
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,810
So this will be like the percentage that has been, you know, that you've drank and this will be an

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,170
I.D. also of percentage.

25
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:52,830
And then inside here I'm just going to do it's going to put 20 percent, but that's going to be dynamic

26
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,850
now underneath this last div so that this is the the cup div.

27
00:01:57,150 --> 00:02:06,480
We're going to have paragraph with the class of text and in here we'll just say select how many glasses

28
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,840
of water that you have.

29
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,120
Drink.

30
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,250
OK, and then underneath the paragraph let's have a class of cups because this is where all the little

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,700
cups are going to go, which are also going to have a class of cup but also a class of cup dash small.

32
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:31,630
OK, and then here we'll say 250 ml and we want eight of these splits.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,480
We'll put a space here.

34
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,820
So let's do it's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

35
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,780
And I'm just going to add the class of full to a couple of these because the full class is going to

36
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,930
give you know, it's going to look like there's like there's water in it.

37
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,730
It's going to be have a blue background.

38
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,220
So we'll say full on the first two.

39
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:52,260
And that should do it for the TML.

40
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,720
It's going to look like this and jump into our success.

41
00:02:55,750 --> 00:03:02,640
I'm going to use the Monserrat font, so I'm going to grab from here, delete that and say success.

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:11,520
Family and family is going to be Munt what is amont Sirat to ours.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:21,120
And for the wait, let's do Colen 400, karma 600 like that and then we'll change your boto to Monserrat

44
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,580
Montserrat.

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,850
I have trouble spelling that for some reason.

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,290
OK, and then for the body here, let's give this a background color and we're going to use hexadecimal

47
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:42,300
value three four nine for e for OK and then we'll give it a color.

48
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,540
Text color will be white, it's more readable.

49
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,300
And then let's see as far as the body here we can get rid of.

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,710
And see, we don't actually need justify content or hype or overflow hidden and then margin, I'm going

51
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:07,020
to set just margin bottom of 40 pixels like that.

52
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:15,510
And then we have some general styles like one for the one I'm going to set margin to do 10 pixels,

53
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:28,200
zero zero, and then the H3, which is the goal when to set the font weight, let's set the font weight

54
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,060
to 400 and let's set the margin to 10 on the top and bottom.

55
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:34,860
All right.

56
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,380
Now we have our cup.

57
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:43,260
So the class of cup, this is for the the one big cup that's going to be up here and for the eight small

58
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,740
ones.

59
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,310
So it's just going to kind of give it that shape.

60
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:53,040
So let's start with giving them a background color of white, OK?

61
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,120
It's going to look like that.

62
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,360
And the border here is going to be let's do four pixels solid.

63
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:07,020
Now, this color I'm going to use as the water color as well as the the font color.

64
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,240
So I'm just going to put some of these colors in custom properties.

65
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,920
So up at the top, you don't have to do this.

66
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:20,550
But since we're going to be repeating some of these colors on the root scope, I'm going to say border

67
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:33,000
dash color and we're going to set that to the value of hexadecimal one for for FC six, OK, which is

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,690
going to be like that darker blue and then for the border here will pass in VA.

69
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,710
And I will say VA will pass in the border color like that.

70
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:50,490
And then the color is also going to be the same color as the border.

71
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,320
So the text color and then let's set a border radius.

72
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,750
I want the top to be straight edged.

73
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:02,820
So zero zero and the bottom left and right will be 40 pixels.

74
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,060
OK, now let's give this these a height.

75
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,940
I'm going to use three hundred and thirty pixels for the height and then the width is going to be 150

76
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,500
pixels.

77
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,610
Now at the moment, all of these are big cups, right?

78
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,170
So they're all this height and with.

79
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:27,240
But later on, we're going to have to remember we have this small class, so we're going to make these

80
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,260
smaller later.

81
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,320
But the initial the initial Highton width will be this.

82
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:39,150
And then we also want to add, let's say, margin 30 pixels on the top and bottom.

83
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,240
And I'm going to display.

84
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:53,490
Flex and let's set the flex direction to column, so we want that want the flex items to be on top of

85
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:59,880
each other and I think that should be let's set overflow to hidden as well.

86
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:06,990
So nothing comes out of the container and we should be good now for the small cups, let's say wherever

87
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,880
there's a cup, a glass of cup and also a cup small.

88
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,870
Then let's set the width of that.

89
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:26,280
So instead of instead of, you know, 330 pixels, let's set the the width to 50 pixels and let's set

90
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,080
a height of ninety five pixels.

91
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,570
So you can see now these are smaller.

92
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:39,210
Now, the the way that the bottom looks, this looks way more rounded because it's smaller.

93
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:44,220
So we want to set instead of having a border radius of, you know, 40 pixels on the bottom, let's

94
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,210
set these to 15 on the bottom and it'll look more, you know, more similar to how this looks.

95
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:59,490
OK, and then let's set let's do a background color of our GBA.

96
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:10,800
Not RGB Q or RGB A and white, so 255 for red, green, blue, and then the alpha value will be zero

97
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:19,560
point nine and then let's set the set a cursor to a pointer because we're going to be clicking on these

98
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,270
to fill them up.

99
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:27,300
So we want that cursor to be a pointer and I'm going to set the font size on this to 14 pixels.

100
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,450
And let's set

101
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:41,960
I'm also going to do a line items to the center because we already have display flex.

102
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:44,370
Remember, the class has display flex.

103
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,060
So I want to line items to the center.

104
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:57,830
I also want to justify content to the center and text a line whoops and also text a line to the center.

105
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:06,060
OK, so I can see that the this text is in the middle and let's add a margin of five pixels.

106
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:13,470
And I want to transition on this as well because when we click on it to fill, we want that like transition

107
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:14,960
effect.

108
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,970
So it's two zero point three seconds and we use the EZ effect.

109
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:31,980
OK, and I think we should be good as far as as far as the small cups, now, we do have a class of

110
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:36,860
cups, plural, wrapped around this, and we want to set that to Aflex block.

111
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,120
So these are in a row.

112
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,430
So let's add the class of cups and set that to display flex.

113
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,250
And as soon as I do that, it's going to display them all in a row.

114
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,100
I do want them to knock on to the next line.

115
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:59,520
So what we'll do is set a flex wrap value of rap and it's not going to go on the next line yet because

116
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,990
we need to add a whip here.

117
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:08,610
So the width I'm going to set on cups is going to be two hundred and eighty pixels and that should just

118
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:13,320
be enough to wrap, you know, after the fourth one, it's going to knock the next one on to the next

119
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,740
line.

120
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:15,770
All right.

121
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:23,080
I'm just going to line items center and justify content center as well.

122
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,010
Good.

123
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,640
Now for the full cups from the first to have a class of full.

124
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:37,470
So I'll say any class of cup that has cup small and fall, I'm going to set the background color to

125
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:47,490
actually I'm going to set this as the as a variable and we'll call this fill color.

126
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,630
And then up here, let's set on the root scope fill color.

127
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:02,160
And this is going to be hexadecimal value six so six A B three F eight.

128
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,890
And now you can see that the first two have this background color because they have that class of fall

129
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,780
now the full class.

130
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,500
We also want to have the color of the text to be white.

131
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,700
So that's a little more readable and that should do it.

132
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:23,040
Now for the four up here, we have the remained remember, a divide with the class of remained and the

133
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,690
did with the class of percentage.

134
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,850
So four remained.

135
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:40,400
Let's see, so remained, I'm going to add display flex, I want to center everything so we'll say a

136
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:49,300
line item center, justify content center and text a line center.

137
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,960
And actually, let's set the flex direction, set that to column.

138
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:08,390
OK, and then I want this to take up, you know, most of this right here, so we'll set the Fleck's

139
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:15,890
value to one and then let's add a transition here as well, because when it fills, we want to have

140
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,010
that kind of like, you know, transition animation effects.

141
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,680
So zero point three seconds is now the span.

142
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,870
So inside the member inside remained.

143
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:35,960
We have this span which has the, you know, wraps around the one point five L so let's say remained

144
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,980
span.

145
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:46,130
And I just want to set the font size on that to twenty pixels and let's set the font weight to bold.

146
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:57,680
OK, and then we have the small tag, so say remained small, which is just the text right here remained

147
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,720
and I just want to set that font size to 12 pixels.

148
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:07,130
All right, now for the percentage part, which is down here.

149
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:18,710
So percentage I'm going to set the background color and I'm going to use the the full color here, so

150
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:31,940
let's take the variable of full color and set that and then make the font size to 30 pixels.

151
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,320
And we want to center this.

152
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:47,690
So let's add display flex and we're going to set a line items to center and justify content to center

153
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,860
that will put that in the middle.

154
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,710
Let's make the font weight bold as well.

155
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:08,820
So what we will do bold work and then let's set the height to zero, so we'll have an initial height

156
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,280
of zero and then transition.

157
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:16,890
We're also going to add here to zero point three seconds, EE's.

158
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,900
All right, I think that should do it and then for the techs down here.

159
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,960
So that's a paragraph with a class of text and all I want to do here is just make sure we text a line

160
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:40,370
to the center and let's also add margin to zero zero five pixels.

161
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,400
All right, cool.

162
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,520
So that should be good for the CSFs.

163
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,880
Now, in the index HTML, we can get rid of the full class here on both of these.

164
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,050
I just wanted to test it out, make sure it looks right.

165
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,290
Also, the data like the 20 percent, we don't need that.

166
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,310
That looks kind of weird because this is empty, but we can still see the top of the 20 percent.

167
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,880
I mean, you could leave it there.

168
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:05,120
It's going to get overwritten by what we have in our JavaScript, but we'll just get rid of that.

169
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:10,730
And then also the one point five L that's going to come from the JavaScript as well.

170
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:15,290
OK, so in the next video, we'll go ahead and we'll start on our script JS file.
