1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,610
OK, so we're going to get started on our movie app, and the first thing we want to do is the HTML,

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:10,120
then we'll jump into the contest and then finally we'll start in our JavaScript to pull in the data.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,640
So in our index, each 12 of our projects start out.

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:21,840
Let's change the title here and call movie app and let's change or let's add into the body here.

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,290
We want a header at the top with a form.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,970
I'm going to give this form an idea of form and insight here.

7
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,470
Actually, we don't need an action.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,550
Get rid of that.

9
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:36,700
So we just want one input in here, which is going to be our search.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,890
I'm going to give it an idea of search and also a class of search, and it's going to be text.

11
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,470
And then let's add a placeholder of search as well, OK?

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,510
And I'm not going to add a button, so we'll just have to hit enter.

13
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,210
If you want to add a button, you can.

14
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,300
But under the header, we're going to have our main area.

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,650
And I'm going to give this an idea of main.

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,010
And ultimately, this is all we're going to have in our HTML because the movies are going to it's going

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,100
to get inserted into the DOM with JavaScript.

18
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,250
But for now, we're just going to go ahead and hardcoded the HTML so we can style it so each one will

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,940
have a class of movie around it and it'll have an image.

20
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:28,260
And for now I'm just going to grab just an on splash stock image of some movie seats and it's going

21
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,760
to take up the whole thing for now.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:37,020
But under that image, we're going to have a div with the class of movie dash info, which is going

23
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,040
to have the title.

24
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:44,430
So an H3 with the movie title and under the movie title will have a span.

25
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,610
Now this is going to be the rating and the color of the text is going to be different depending on the

26
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,090
rating.

27
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:53,240
So it'll be green if it's a high rating.

28
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:58,410
I think it's a ten point scale, but we'll just say like nine point eight so that that'll have a class

29
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,020
of green in the JavaScript will make it dynamic.

30
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,790
If it's a low rating, it'll be red.

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,100
If it's a mid rating, it'll be orange.

32
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,000
Now, under the movie info div, we're going to have our overview.

33
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,880
So class of overview.

34
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:19,590
And inside here, it's just going to be an H3 with overview as a label.

35
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:28,100
And then let's do LAAM 20 just for some dummy text here and then that should do it for the movie.

36
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,330
Now we're going to have a lot of these movie divs that are going to be inserted from the JavaScript

37
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,800
with the API data.

38
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,540
So I'm going to copy that and just put two more these movie divs in here for now.

39
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,420
And then in our stylesheet here, I'm going to use the Poppins font, so I'm going to highlight Raboteau

40
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,260
here, command highlighted here and change it to Poppins hit Escape to get back to my cursor up here

41
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,440
and let's use 200 400 for the weight.

42
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:01,800
And in the body we can get rid of everything except the font family and the margin zero.

43
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,630
OK, because we're not using Flex to, you know, put put in the middle like we have with most projects

44
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,320
because we do have a header, you know, that we're going to have and then the movies.

45
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:21,120
So I do want to add a background color here and we'll be using this color and another one throughout

46
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,230
the project.

47
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,310
So I'm going to put them into custom properties on the root scope.

48
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,620
So let's have a custom property or variable called primary dash color.

49
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:38,190
And this is going to be two two two five four B, it's going to be that.

50
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:45,810
And then we'll have a secondary color, which is going to be hexadecimal three seven three B six nine.

51
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,070
And let's call this.

52
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,080
Secondary, OK, and then primary color here is will say var.

53
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:59,500
This is the syntax for custom properties is var parentheses and then whatever the variable.

54
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,320
OK, so you can see that now the header, we want to style that.

55
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:15,750
So header I'm going to add some padding will do one to one room padding and I'm going to display Fleck's

56
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:22,100
and there's only one Fleck's item which is the form and I want to align that all the way to the right.

57
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:27,390
So I'm going to use to justify content Fleck's and which will push it all the way over and then let's

58
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,440
style the search box itself.

59
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:38,720
So search I'm going to set the background color to transparence and let's set the border.

60
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,820
So the border is going to be two pixel solid and it's going to be the secondary color.

61
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:50,490
So var dash dash secondary color and actually.

62
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:51,390
No, wait a minute.

63
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,580
Do we want that now.

64
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,270
We want the primary color for that.

65
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,080
Actually.

66
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,200
Hold on a second.

67
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,000
The header, yeah, the header, we actually want to have a background of the secondary color, so I'm

68
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,490
going to paste that in and change that to secondary.

69
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,070
There we go.

70
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,030
All right.

71
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:23,720
So I also want the border radius to be 50 pixels for the search form.

72
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,900
And let's make sure we inherit four font family.

73
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:38,760
We want to inherit our Poppins font, and then I'm going to increase the font size to one room and I'm

74
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,200
going to add some padding.

75
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,540
So we'll do point five from top and bottom one room, left and right.

76
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,060
And the color of the text that we type in will be white and that should do it.

77
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,150
I also want to change the color of the placeholder.

78
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:57,410
So search colon, colon placeholder.

79
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,460
Let's make that color.

80
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:07,200
This is actually going to be a seven three seven eight SI five.

81
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:15,290
OK, so I can see it has that purplish color and for the focus, so let's say search colon focus.

82
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:19,410
So when we click inside of it, I want to remove any outline.

83
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,970
So outline will be none.

84
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,000
But I also want to change the background color to be the primary colors so far.

85
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,570
Dash, dash, primary colors.

86
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,910
If I click in here, you can see it gets that background color.

87
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,400
All right, now let's do the movie area.

88
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,920
So are the main area, I should say.

89
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:45,450
So for Main, I'm going to display Flex because remember all the divs with the class of movies, those

90
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:47,670
are going to be flex items within Mane.

91
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,740
So it'll turn it into a flex row.

92
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,320
And I want them to wrap onto the next line.

93
00:06:52,320 --> 00:07:00,900
So Flex Wrap will set to wrap and then I'm just going to grab the image so each div has a class of movie

94
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,520
and then we have an image inside.

95
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,520
I want that to be 100 percent of its container, which right now just goes all the way across.

96
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:14,370
But let's set the movie so each movie class will have a width of three hundred pixels.

97
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:15,840
All right.

98
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,320
And then we'll go ahead and add a margin of one ram to separate them out.

99
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,030
I'm also going to do back for a background background color.

100
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,250
I'm going to set that to the secondary color.

101
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:35,940
So var dash dash secondary color and we'll add a little box shadow.

102
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:46,800
So box shadow for the offsets will do zero for pixel by pixel blur arga black and zero point two for

103
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,370
the alpha.

104
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:53,130
So it gives it a little bit of a shadow and I'm going to position this relative so that we can position

105
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,450
other things inside of it.

106
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,200
Absolute.

107
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:06,960
I'm going to set the overflow to hidden and I'm going to set the border radius to three pixels so it's

108
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,160
just slightly rounded.

109
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:21,990
OK, now the movie info is the title and the rating, so class movie info and I'm going to first change

110
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:28,050
the color, make that brighter and I want to display Flex because I want it to be, you know, the title

111
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,640
here in the rating over here.

112
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,300
So if we do display Flex and let's take any.

113
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:50,060
Let's see, let's take the margin top off of the heading, so movie info three, that set margin top

114
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,930
to zero like that.

115
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:52,760
All right.

116
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:59,580
So we have display flex, let's line items to the center and let's justify content.

117
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:05,090
I want to put the space, the extra space between them so it pushes the rating all the way over.

118
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:15,140
And then for padding, let's do zero point five ram, one ram and then one ram on the bottom as well.

119
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:26,580
All right, and then I'm just going to add letter spacing here, and we're going to do point half a

120
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,170
pixel, point five pixel.

121
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:34,920
All right, now, what should we do next here?

122
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:41,970
The span, which is the rating here is going to have we're going to have the ability to add separate

123
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:46,080
classes depending on, you know, how high or low the rating is.

124
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,280
So we need those classes.

125
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,180
But the base class or the base element.

126
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:58,320
So movie info span, let's add a background color and that's going to be for the spane.

127
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,740
Let's do VARE and we're going to use our primary color like that.

128
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,910
And let's set.

129
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:15,040
Some padding on that, so we'll do point to five from top and bottom, point five from left and right.

130
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,290
Good.

131
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:24,980
Let's set a border radius of three pixels and then let's set font weight to bold.

132
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,490
OK, so that's our rating.

133
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:32,240
Now we want the different color classes.

134
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,720
So let's just grab that.

135
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,840
And let's say if it has a class of green, let's set color to green.

136
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,510
Actually, that's a little too dark.

137
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,130
Let's do.

138
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:55,420
It's light green look like, you know, we can do that, and then let's just take this, we want three

139
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:04,990
of these and the second one here is going to be orange and we'll set this color to orange.

140
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:12,700
And then this one here is going to be red and will set this one to red.

141
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:19,030
Right now, if one of these ratings, like, let's say this last one is is three point eight and we

142
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:22,430
set the class to red, then it's going to have a red coloring.

143
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,530
Now, the last part of this is the overview.

144
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,330
And the overview is going to be the white part that when we hover over, it's going to you know, it's

145
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,060
going to come up from the bottom.

146
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:34,960
So we want to add a transition on that.

147
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,920
But let's style overview first.

148
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:48,220
So I'm going to set the background color to white on overview and let's set some padding so it's not

149
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,010
up against the sides will do to some padding.

150
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,180
We're going to position this to be absolute.

151
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:04,300
And as far as you know, where we want to position this, let's do top top left, top zero, bottom

152
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,760
zero and right zero.

153
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,950
I'm sorry, not top left.

154
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,740
So we want left and right, zero and bottom.

155
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:15,670
All right.

156
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,990
So it should look like that.

157
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,420
And then.

158
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,230
Yeah, and then I'm going to set a max height of one hundred percent.

159
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:33,850
OK, now we don't want this to show initially what I want to do is have it pushed all the way down out

160
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:40,570
of the box and then when we hover, it comes up, transitions up so we can move it down with transform

161
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:46,270
and then we can use translate whi, which translates or moves it on the Y axis and I want to move it

162
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,280
down so it'll be a positive number.

163
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,450
We're going to do 101 percent.

164
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,620
So 100 percent of its height plus one more percent, which will move it all the way down.

165
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:02,680
If I set this to like 50 percent, it'll push it 50 percent down, but we want it off screen to begin

166
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:08,050
with and then when we hover it, so we'll say overview hover.

167
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,270
I'm sorry, not overview.

168
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,520
However, we want movie.

169
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:19,960
So when we when we hover over a movie, which is the entire box, then we want the overview to change

170
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:26,410
its transform translate why to zero, which is its original positioning.

171
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,120
Now if I hover over you can see it, it does that, but there's no transition yet.

172
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,370
So let's add a transition on to this.

173
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,360
We want transition and we want to transition.

174
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,050
The transform property will do zero point three second duration and we'll do an ease in effect.

175
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,850
So that way when I hover over it just kind of slides up, which is what I want.

176
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:55,210
OK, so now that we have the design down in, the next video will jump into our script J.S. and pull

177
00:13:55,210 --> 00:14:02,410
in the data from the API using fetch and then ultimately insert these cards with the dynamic movie data.
